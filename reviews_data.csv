"Recently tried @toriyamasg 's yakitori and I must say many of them were splendid � Although they can be a little pricey, the sticks came with huge chunks of meat which were very inviting. One of my favourites got to be their Salmon ($6), as it was so well seasoned and well grilled. It was meaty, tender and just an irresistible bite. Their Eggplant Miso ($5) was interesting too, as it had a sweet savoury marinade and was cooked through without being slimy. Non-eggplant fans will still love them!
Their mains were decent, but nothing to shout out about. I believe it's best to come here just for some good yakitori and mains! Location wise it's quite near the hipster Tiong Bahru area. Thank you @foodleaguesg for inviting and @toriyamasg for the food!",4
"Finally tried @doqoosg 's famous mochi waffles and it was pretty decent! I think it's a great snack to have but there's no need to travel far and wide for it �
The Chocolate Mochi Waffles ($3.50) was surprisingly not so sweet, with a pretty deep chocolate flavour in the waffles. When eaten hot fresh out of the pan, the waffles had a slightly crispy exterior, soft fluffy centre and the mochi within was very stretchy � definitely best eaten on the spot, the texture of the whole combination wouldn't be great when cold. The mochi itself does not have much flavour, so they mostly contributed through its chewy texture.
A great snack to have if you are around the area!",4
"Got myself a bowl of dry Ban Mian with meatballs ($5.50) from He Jia Huan for lunch and I was so impressed � I thought their soup noodles were quite good already, but their dry version is even better!
The sauce to mix with the noodles is of a simple blend of soya sauce, flavoured oil and chilli, but it was so addictive due it's savoury umami profile. The chilli had some heat, and some kind of nostalgic taste which was hard to describe. I loved how the noodles were really chewy, as how handmade noodles should be! The portion is quite decent as well, with tender flavourful pork slices and pork balls. For a palette cleanser, the soup can help to cut the oiliness with its deep ikan billis broth.
Definitely a noodle dish I will get when I'm back at Redhill Food Centre again �

"Korean BBQ restaurants are in abundance here in Singapore, but I really think @hanjip.sg is a cut above due to its meat quality as well as its consistency in food quality among varying types of dishes. Yes prices might be abit higher than other places, but food quality is really good here! It was so hard to choose favourites, but here are my top picks:
USDA Prime Rib-eye from the Hanjip Platter ($188) - the platter may be quite pricey, but it's quality meat you're getting. The rib-eye was my favourite, as the grilling was done so well as our steak was perfectly medium rare with a smoky crust on the outside. Biting into a piece with salt unleashes an explosion of flavours, and it was so tender too!
Marinated Pork Collar from the Hanjip Platter - soft, sweet and savoury, this was exactly the quality I got when I had the same dish in Korea. Perfect with kimchi and saam!
Beef Short Ribs Stew ($35) - the flavour of the soup was incredibly deep and it was telling of how long they cooked the beef bones for. The short rib pieces were thick, meaty and very tender as well. This is one very well executed soup dish.
Soy Korean Fried Half Chicken ($30) - never thought they can do fried chicken well too. The batter was light and crispy and the inside was tender and juicy. The marinade penetrated deep into the meat, and I loved the garlic soy sauce on the outside as well. So satisfying!
Do pair your food with @chorongchorong.official
's soju as they did not taste too artificial like other brands! Personally like them alot �
Let me share with you a special offer, if you reserve through CHOPE, they will be giving out complimentary plate of Wagyu beef brisket! Also, if you order anKorean BBQ restaurants are in abundance here in Singapore, but I really think @hanjip.sg is a cut above due to its meat quality as well as its consistency in food quality among varying types of dishes. Yes prices might be abit higher than other places, but food quality is really good here! It y set meals on weekend lunch, they will give a complimentary plate of Kurobuta Pork Belly! I've tried both and they were fantastic too �
Can't compliment this place enough. Can't wait for my next trip here!",5
"If you have a spicy appetite, @xiaolongkansg would be a hotpot restaurant for you to consider. With incredibly spicy yet authentic mala soup base and chilli covered meats, you are bound to get your chilli craving fixed here!
The Mala broth itself was a little different in flavour as compared to other restaurants, as the natural flavour of the chilli is more pronounced. We ordered small spice and it had quite a kick already! The other half of the pot we had pork bone soup which was decent, not too flavourful but not too salty as well, even towards the end of the meal.
If you want spice on spice, the Hot and Spicy Beef is for you. Each piece was smoked and a huge amount of chilli flakes were pressed onto it. I mostly taste the natural flavour of chilli used; most Singaporeans may not be accustomed to eating like this but some may like it!
Their other meat options were decent, pork slices were fresh and tender.
Interestingly, my favourite dish among all we ordered was their fried mantou � it was actually fried very well with a crispy outer crust and a fluffy inside without being too oily. Perfect with the condensed milk!
If you would like a good sauce to accompany your meats, I recommend you add their fragrant oil which comes in a plastic can. It reminded me of a mixture between sesame and shallot oil which was just bangin' �
A hotpot to consider if you want some spicy kick. Personally, I didn't quite appreciate the spice. Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting and @foodspo.koh for joining us! Total including other meats like cuttlefish paste and prawns was about $150 for 4 pax.",3
"I'm happy to report that the Wagyu donburi at @waacowsg is still as good as before � it's been many years since I've had my last bowl at Waa Cow, and this was still very satisfying!
I had the Original Wagyu Donburi ($22.90) and it came filled with pieces of tender and flavourful beef slices! They were smoky and well seasoned and absolutely perfect with the onsen egg provided. The Japanese rice was flavourful slightly with the sauce on the beef too.
For sides, I highly recommend their Truffle Fries ($14.90). They may be thin, but they were satisfyingly crispy with just a slight fluffiness. The truffle mayo made the fries even more addictive!
The donburis might be a little costly, but your heart and stomach will thank you �",5
"I wondered why so many people loved @xiangxiangsg and I now know why. With good food, good service and free snacks, what's there not to love? Join their free membership and you can get quite a good discount too!
The Golden Broth Sour and Spicy Fish ($25.90 member price) was a crowd favourite, due to its comforting flavourful broth. It isn't too spicy, and the fish slices had a wonderful bouncy tender, signifying its freshness. This is so good with rice!
Their 18 second Angus Beef Stir-fry ($18.90 member price) is also another good order. Bold in flavours, the beef slices were relatively tender and quite smoky. We absolutely loved the garlic pieces as they had so much umami! Definitely a beer food material as it was so addictive!
Finally, their claypot tofu stew ($14.90 member price) was another staple we had to order. The taste is familiar, but better than the usual claypot tofu. Their tofu is also different, as it had a fish cake texture instead.
There were other dishes that we had but they weren't worth mentioning. I must say their dishes were mostly executed well. I wouldn't say they are the best, but they have the quality and price range that would be accessible to most families and they do warrant return trips. Can't wait to be back!",4
"Found out that @kappoaraisg is new to the omakase scene and decided to try it out! Their omakase menu ($99) changes monthly and they usually come with a variety of cooked dishes. I must say, most of the items served were all decent, but not mind-blowing. The sashimi and sushi courses were all fresh. Their strength seems to be yakitori and sukiyaki instead, as these 2 courses were the ones which were exceptional.
I loved their chicken yakitori, as it was so flavourful even though the chicken was just seasoned with salt. Even the chicken breast was so moist!
Their A5 Wagyu Sukiyaki was simply stunning. The beef slices were so tender and flavourful, and they paired so well with the onsen egg. The sauce was such a good rendition, as it was so wonderfully aromatic with sweet and savoury flavours!
All in all, considering the whole package, I would think is a can try but not a must try. The ambience is a very casual one, and I really didn't like the English pop playing in the background as it didn't seem to fit the atmosphere well. Just a personal preference!",4
"So glad to have tried @nickel.sg recently, as their coffee and matcha drinks were simply fantastic � to add on to that, their cafe is also really aesthetic!
The Iced Latte ($7) was a very smooth cup, and it was rich and aromatic. Chocolate and nutty notes were strong, and the milk amount was just nice. Definitely a wonderful blend that is worth sipping!
The Dirty Matcha ($8) was also a flavourful cup. The matcha powder used was of a high quality and hence it was intense and aromatic. The matcha itself was very nutty, almost to the point that it tastes slightly savoury. I actually like this kind of intense matcha and hence it worked out well for me! The Matcha was hand-wisked as well, so it was really smooth � It did overpower the coffee notes quite a bit so maybe it's better to just order the Iced Matcha Latte instead!
Loved the touch of mini Madeleines as well. It was crispy and buttery, perfect with the drinks we got.
Definitely an aesthetic cafe that you should come try! Their desserts look good too!",5
"Not sure if there are people like me who enjoy an old school traditional Kopitiam experience, but if you do, this place has the vibes and food that is like that. From the seemingly rude aunty and uncle shouting to the slamming of plates and bowls in front of you, I actually dig into such vibes �
Wait till you try their food. Their Yong Tau Foo ($5) is up to the owner to decide which ingredients to give you, and each of them was bursting with a nostalgic taste. It's not like it's so good that you need to come from the far end to try, but each ingredient is handmade with simple meat filling. To cater for the older crowd, they were not too salty and the soup was very comforting and hearty. Not the most flavourful, but definitely perfect for a rainy day.
Now their ingredients come with a plate of dry noodles that were just simply seasoned with minced meat with some kind of flavoured oil. It has an al dente texture and is much better with their homemade chilli. It was not particularly spicy but flavourful.
I feel like it is an experience to dine here, as it reminds you of the olden days where people probably ate the same bowl to get by their day. Such sentimental feelings were probably intensified by the look and feel of the shophouses nearby!",5
"If you are looking for some hearty Chinese dishes, @min_xiao_min is a relatively new restaurant that may be able to satisfy your cravings! We tried some of their speciality items and here were my favourites:
Fried Pork In Spring Rolls ($7.80) - I have eaten many Ngoh Hiang in my life, and these hit different � they were very freshly fried, and the meat filling within was very meaty and flavourful. Definitely loved it with their sweet chilli sauce. Not sure if that's the original portion though, as its expensive for 2 rolls.
Tenderised Pork Knuckles in Vinegar ($18.80) - a classic Chinese dish, this was a good rendition. The meat itself was tender, and the skin and fat just melted in the mouth. It can get really rich and surfeiting, so it's best to get some rice for the gravy and share this dish.
Their dishes were definitely decent and worth a visit if you are nearby! Prices were relatively affordable too considering the Clarke Quay area. Thank you @foodleaguesg for the invite and @min_xiao_min for the food! Do follow them for updates!",4
"Recently been to @modcafesg and we fell in love with the cozy vibe and I especially loved their desserts and coffee �
Their Lava Cake ($9.90) was simply a chocolate lover's dream, as it was so rich with quality chocolate flavours! This paired well with the aromatic vanilla ice cream! I also loved the crunchy almond slices too, as they were fresh and added another dimension of texture to the lava cake.
We also tried many of their savoury main and side options, and they were all decent, but my favourite is still their Eggdrop Toast ($7). This was so similar to my favourite egg toast in Korea � the scrambled eggs were done right, as it was fluffy and creamy. Flavours were on point, with a sweet and savoury combination which just works. Definitely a brunch worthy dish, which I would get with coffee.
Speaking of which, I tried a bit of my friend's Mocha ($7.90) and I loved it! I wished I could have more of it but it was dinner time � Not only was it rich and chocolatey, you can still taste the aromatic coffee notes as it gets more prominent towards the end of the taste profile. Definitely would be an enjoyable cuppa. Iced Matcha ($7.9) was decent.
Definitely a cafe I will come back for, especially for their coffee and desserts. Thank you @thatfoodadv for inviting and @modcafesg for hosting us! Do note that seats are quite limited here!",5
"If you're around the area and don't mind some Kopitiam western food, @skinnychef_sg is an option you can go for!
I got myself a Half Spring Chicken ($8) with herb rice and sauteed mushrooms, and I was blown away by the size of the fried chicken. It was also well fried, as the crust was crispy and chicken within was succulent. The seasoning penetrated the chicken well, and I didn't need any sauce even for the breast portion. The batter itself had an interesting seasoning, as it was slightly sweet and salty which made it addictive.
My partner had Grilled Salmon ($14), which may appear dry but it was actually very succulent and tender within! It's interesting how they also separated the skin from the meat and grilled it into a crackling. That itself was addictive too!
Sides for all mains were just normal, nothing much to shout out about.
For finger food, both the Cheese Fries ($4.50) and Salt & Pepper Fish ($4.50) came in huge portions and they were just alright too.
I would come back for their Spring Chicken definitely! At the affordable price it's value for money! Thank you @skinnychef_sg for the food and @wantwoeatsg for the invite!",4
"If you love your durian, this is one dessert shop @dessertfirstsg to go for. Though there are some elements within the Durian Shaved Ice ($11.50) that I didn't like, there were some that I absolutely adored �
The Durian Shaved Ice comes with durian flavoured ice, durian cream, durian meat and durian ice cream. Eating all of them together was very satisfying, as it was so rich with durian flavours! The durian cream was so potent in flavour, and the durian meat was sweet, aromatic and just slightly bitter. I actually didn't like the ice cream and ice itself, as they seem to taste too artificial. Seems like their Durian Shaved Ice (a different dessert bowl) would be my option next time as they did not have the components that I didn't like!
As an avid durian lover, I'm definitely coming back for more!",4
"Finally tried @fatbird.sg and I was hooked! Their chicken pot was indeed very comforting and tasty �
We had the Large Chicken Pot ($38.80 - 30% off with #burpplebeyond ) and it came MASSIVE. The portion is definitely more than enough to feed 4-6 people, as they gave so much chicken within. The chicken pieces were very tender and well marinated as well. We got the original house special sauce, which was very comforting due to its sweet, savoury and spicy flavours.
As the pot mainly contains just chicken and Enoki mushrooms, I highly recommend ordering the vegetable platter ($13.80) to go with it. The platter came with a heaping amount of different vegetable types, including potato and lotus root which were great additions to the broth.
For starters, the Salted Egg Yolk Corn ($10.80) is a great sharing dish as it was sweet and savoury; a fun dish to munch on if you do order some beer!
Do note that their soup can get quite salty towards the end, and I recommend adding water instead of their broth at the end. Definitely coming back for their hearty chicken pot and massive portions �",5
"Located near Lavender MRT station, @crabwangimperialcatering offers a variety of zi-char dishes for families to enjoy. While I find the crab fried rice underwhelming, the other dishes were pretty decent. My favourite was actually the chicken stir fried with ginger and onions, as it was comforting and perfect with some rice.
You can follow them on FB with the similar usernames.
Thank you @foodleaguesg for the invite and @crabwangimperialcatering for the food!",3
"You know your food is going to be good when the Vietnamese servers start taking your orders quite angrily � and true enough the food here we had was very decent and definitely above average! It was an authentic experience as well as there were Vietnamese people dining around us!
To me, the Vietnamese Spring Rolls ($10) are a must order, as the crispy outer shell is just so inviting. The ones here are quite huge, and I'm glad they were stuffed with quite abit of pork meat. Pair them with the sweet chilli sauce and you got yourself a wonderful side �
The Rare Beef Noodle Soup ($9.50) was really comforting and the broth flavour was quite deep! Noodles were cooked just right and beef slices were tender. This is one hearty soup to have on rainy days! The portion was big as well.
Their Beef Stew with Baguette ($10) is also a must order. The beef cubes were really tender, and it was SO flavourful. It was both sweet and savoury and it was such a good stew to just dip the bread in. Speaking of which, the baguette or banh mi was perfectly baked; crispy on the outside and fluffy within. Give me that and the stew and I will be a happy man.
Dishes mentioned above are recommended! The rest were okay. I'm definitely coming back here if I'm around in the joo chiat region!",4
"Tried the popular @junecoffeesg recently and honestly based on the drinks we've had, we feel like it's overhyped �
The Iced Black Sesame Latte ($8) had a savoury black sesame cream that was fragrant at the start, but as you drink the coffee, the taste of the black sesame gets more and more subtle somehow. Coffee itself was decent, aromatic but nothing much to shout out about.
The Jasmine & Green Grape ($7.50) unfortunately fell short of expectations as the grapes used were sour and the flavour combination of the jasmine tea and sour grapes did not work out for us!
We queued for at least an hour as we had 4 people; they did not have many big tables so please take note! Just feel like you can get similar standards somewhere else without the queues...",2
"Quite unknown to the omakase scene here in Singapore, you will be surprised to know that @monte.risaia.sg is actually quite liked by the Japanese crowd, as 60-70% of their clientele are Japanese.
I had their 5 course lunch omakase ($98) and I left really satisfied! The whole experience was very intimate, as you can have small conversations with the Japanese chef and the Singaporean staff. Food items were simple and non-pretentious; you don't get really instagrammable food but the chef really knows how to bring out the best of fresh ingredients.
Take the Lobster Bisque for example, the soup seemed simple as it just had scallops within but the broth itself was so deep. You can taste the rich umami flavours and yet it was not too salty. Scallops were torched well for a smoky flavour and their meat itself was sweet.
Even their signature pasta was glorious, it was a simple fusion tomato pasta that was seasoned with garlic and shiso leaves but yet it was one of the best pasta I've had. Tomatoes were naturally sweet, the garlic flavours were brought out naturally, and best of all the pasta was perfectly al dente. The Japanese element of shiso leaves gave the pasta another dimension of flavours!
Definitely coming back again for more. Heard that their menu changes frequently so I can't wait for my next treat here!",5
"If you are looking for good coffee in Novena, @love.joy.coffee got you your cuppa! Located near the food court in Velocity, we had great cups of coffee there that left our hearts full and belly satisfied.
Their Petit White ($4.50) was a small cup of single shot hot latte that was just so smooth and rich. The aromatic scent of the coffee was very inviting, and it had the right hazelnut and chocolate notes. Their Iced Latte ($6) was also a great refreshing cup, with just the right amount of strength and milk within. This is one cup I can sip away slowly definitely!
Can't wait to be back for another cup �",5
"Most bars don't serve up quality food, but it's not the case here at @ichi.1sg because we all thoroughly enjoyed most of their dishes.
Their Hamachi Kama ($28) was just spot on. The skin was grilled till crispy, while the meat within was fresh, sweet and succulent! It was meaty pieces and the sweet salty marinade gave it so much flavour. Wished I had the whole plate to myself �
Their Scallop Mentaiko Pasta was so rich and full of Mentaiko as well; mentaiko lovers would rejoice! But this can be surfeiting so it's good to share!
Their Salted Egg Oyster Mushrooms are also a nice sharing dish. The oyster mushrooms were crispy and the salted egg sauce was glorious. Wished I had rice to mop them up �
Finally of course, you have to have pizza to share in a bar. Their Smoked Salmon Pizza came quite filled with smoked salmon pieces and cheese, and their crust can be quite crispy! I like it but for people who prefer a doughier crust may not so!
For drinks, @chorongchorong.official would be your go-to. They have a couple of flavours here, but personally, I like the Bohae raspberry wine instead as it's a sweet easy drink to begin with � quite rare to find this wine in Singapore bars!
One thing to note, is that they have live performances from Thurs to Sat. You can enjoy your good food with some good songs � There are daily alcohol promotions as well, like 2 beer towers for $108 on Monday, and 3 beer towers for $208 on Thursday. Prices of food can be abit steep here, but they do serve up good quality. In the heart of Clarke Quay, this is one bar for you to consider! You can reserve on chope and quote ""ICHIPLATTER"" to get a free plate of sashimi!",4
"@lolascafesg is not new to the cafe scene and among brunch lovers, but I'm glad that they opened a new outlet nearer to my neighbourhood! With a huge beautiful space, we had to get down to try their food and coffee �
Their Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($17) boasts a filling amount of melted cheese and they had such a deep rich flavour! Seasoned with aromatic herbs, this did not feel too surfeiting and definitely can be finished by one. If you like the sweet savoury combo, their paprika honey comes in handy! I must say I like my grilled cheese plain with just cheese and maybe ham, so this was interesting to me.
The Seafood Benedict ($20) came with 2 buns topped with a freshly fried seafood cake and poached eggs and this was lovely. The cake was filled with prawn and crab, and the aroma of dill was so inviting! A very satisfying meal �
As for their coffee, I loved their Iced Latte ($6.50) with the house blend, as it had great hazelnut and chocolate notes and it was so rich! The Iced Mocha ($7) was also good, as you can taste both the chocolate and coffee. Chocolate used was of high quality!
If you are thinking of a treat, this is a good place to consider. Will be back again!",4
"Putu Piring ($2.50 for 4) from Haig Road Putu Piring - now this is a famous one, and I couldn't leave the food centre without having it! Indeed this was probably the best Putu Piring I've had. The flour and gula melaka used was somehow different, it was much more aromatic than others that I've had before. A sweet treat to end the meal! �",5
"Pork and Chicken Satay ($0.80 each) from Mei Mei Satay - the satay meat was pretty sizeable! I loved the marinade used; it was well charred and it made the meat quite tender, even for the pork version. The satay sauce unfortunately isn't peanut-y enough, but it was fine for me as the pineapple juice helped cut the meatiness of satay!",5
"Signature Kolo Mee ($5.50) from Lin Yu Mei - now this is probably the best Kolo Mee I've had. The noodles were perfectly springy, well tossed in shallot and lard oil while not being too oily and the chilli was amazing. It was very fiery, and yet it had a beautiful aroma which made this dish even better. Never mind the minced meat and char siu, just give me their noodles and chilli and I will be a happy man.",5
"I recently had a chance to dine at @themadmanco, and managed to try a couple of small bites, burgers and hot sauces they offered! Here are some of my favourites:
Grilled Jamaican Jerk Wings ($15) - they can be a bit small and expensive, but they do pack a punch in terms of their flavour. The Jamaican Jerk marinade penetrated the meat well, giving it a nice savouriness with a touch of tangy notes. They were grilled well, as it was smoky as well.
They brought back their burgers from The Social Outcast, and the Meat Mafia ($26) was the one I preferred. Loads of meaty ingredients and cheese, the Wagyu patty was quite juicy. It does lack in seasoning for me, but this is when the hot sauces come in to make everything better. The Cholula Chipotle gave it additional flavour and made each bite a wholesome one! Vegan options for their burgers are available upon request!
Last but not least, the Cured Duck Prosciutto ($12) won my heart. The duck pieces were melt-in-the-mouth, and they gave so much umami. This complements well with the crispy grilled bread, as well as the bonito flakes!
I think this is an interesting concept, where you can come down to try the various hot sauces they have with the food they offer! Thank you @themadmanco for the food and @burpple for the food once again!",4
"If you haven't had the nian gao waffles at @thebetterscoop yet, it's time to do it this weekend. I absolutely fell in love with the rendition at their new Anchovale Village outlet as it was just so good!
The Nian Gao Waffles ($6.80) we've got came crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I like how buttery and aromatic their waffles were, and that they gave a rather huge portion of Nian Gao! This gives them a chewy texture which was well appreciated.
To go with their waffles, we got their Peanut and Black Sesame Muah Chee and Tie Guan Yin ($9.50 for both scoops). The peanut and black sesame muah chee was such an awesome flavour, as it tasted very much like the muah chee I used to eat often as a kid. Both flavours in the gelato were pronounced and complemented each other so well! There were additional muah chee cubes within too. The Tie Guan Yin flavour was much lighter yet still fragrant, perfect for those who prefer a more refreshing taste. Both flavours are absolutely recommended.
Can't wait for my next time here! Definitely one of the best nian gao waffles I've had!",5
"Buangkok peeps should rejoice, as there's now a quality and affordable pizza kiosk in your area �
@eatnowpizza offers affordable 9 inch pizzas, with most going at $10.90. At such prices you get handmade sourdough pizza that is pretty loaded with ingredients! My favourite was the Meat Mania ($10.90) pizza, as the sauce was spot on with its strong savouriness and there were loads of ingredients like ham, pepperoni and cheese � the stretchy sourdough crust was such a joy to eat, as it was really tasty on its own and had a great mouth feel!
If you like sweet savoury flavours, the Spicy Beef Pepperoni ($10.90) would be your choice. Not only you get a good savoury meaty flavour, the spicy paprika honey added sweetness and some heat that was well appreciated!
The Chicken Tenders ($6.90) and Mozzarella Cheese Sticks ($4.90) were okay, nothing much to shout out about. However, their pizzas are really worth trying! At such a price and quality, I would grab this for lunch or dinner if I'm staying nearby! Thank you @eatnowpizza for the invite and food!",4
"Hidden among the landed estates, @bitesnbrews_sg offers a variety of western fare that does not seem to be commonly sold. Prices can be quite steep, but I must say with the lovely vintage deco and the chill vibes, this place is quite date worthy!
The Spinach Tagliatelle ($26) came with a heaping amount of rockett leaves � the spinach pasta below is quite al dente, and well seasoned with spices and loads of savoury capers. Prawns were fresh!
The Grilled Australian Wagyu Rib-eye ($48) was tender and quite juicy. It could do with a bit more seasoning, though the sauce below does help in making it better. Do note that the sauce is on a sweeter and sour side, so these 2 flavours are more prominent, contrary to the usual salt and pepper seasoning to steaks.
Now their desserts are an eye catcher. The Warm Berry Galette ($23) was similar to a berry pie, and it was really refreshing with its tangy notes! The crust is on the softer side, and the strawberry camomile gelato made it even nicer. Loved the hot and cold combination!
Drinks were okay, and the food overall was decent. A pretty cafe to visit for a date perhaps? Thank you @bitesnbrews_sg for the invite and food!",4
"Known among the local crowd for gelato and waffles, @chatters_gelato offers more than just desserts, as they can also whip up some quick bites and delicious sandwiches!
Their Smoked Salmon Tartar Twist ($11.90) came stuffed full of ingredients and the combination tasted pretty delicious! There was a good blend of savoury and tangy flavours, with the umami of smoked salmon coming through strongly. Admittedly, I do hope that the sandwich was served cold!
As for their desserts, between their Mochi Waffles and Croffles, I do prefer their croffles more. Crispy and buttery, I loved the chewy texture within as well � You have to get their durian gelato to go with their croffle, as it was so rich and aromatic, perfect for durian lovers!
Their Iced Latte ($6.20) was good as well, as it was quite a strong cuppa. Thank you @chatters_gelato for the food and @foodiecouplecm for the invite!",4
"Found a hidden gem in the heart of the novena area! @thecluelessgoat offers affordable delicious brunch fares that is good for work lunches around here �
I had the Scrambled Eggs on Toast ($8.50) which was pretty affordable considering the price of such brunch fare elsewhere. The scrambled eggs were very well done, as it was creamy and well seasoned. I also loved the stretchy cheese below, and the chewy sourdough.
If you are in a bigger group, getting their truffle fries ($9) is a good idea as it was so big! The portion can easily be shared among 3-4 people. The shaved cheese on top is well appreciated but do note that the truffle taste is not so prominent. Fries were crispy, but not too fluffy inside. Quite decent but of course not the best!
Their Iced Latte ($7) was also delicious, as it was strong, not too milky and of a medium roast. Not too acidic, it was a decent cup to enjoy!
All in all, I would come back as their food items are value for money!",4
"Kanada-Ya recently released their Mala series, which includes soup ramen, Mazesoba as well as some side dishes. We tried many of them and they were delicious ~~
The Mala Tonkotsu Ramen ($16.90) was indeed quite spicy, with much of the spice kicking in at the back of your throat. The pork broth itself was very lovely, with deep pork bone flavours almost shouting in your face. Noodles were alright, thought I wish they could be more al dente. Do note that it tastes more like spicy tonkotsu than mala! Definitely a decent ramen to get for spicy lovers.
I actually love their Mala Mazesoba ($12.90) more, as the mala flavours are more pronounced. The noodles are much chewier here and umami flavours from the meat were strong too! Definitely a spicy bowl but will be addictive to some!
Everyone, we have come to the best item we had ordered, which is their Mala Fried Chicken ($8.90). This came in huge chunks, and they were so tender and juicy. Fat from the chicken almost dripped down as I bit into it! It was well seasoned all the way through the chicken meat and the mala paste did well in enhancing the flavours more.
Honestly I'm not a big spicy eater, but the normal variations of their dishes are good. Definitely coming back for their non spicy variations for my ramen fix! Thank you @kanadaya.sg for inviting and for the food!",5
"If you are looking for solid coffee in an aesthetic environment, look no further as @alchemist.sg had done it right. They have repurposed the old Khong Guan factory as their cafe, giving it a good mix of both retro and modern vibes!
I ordered the Iced Latte ($7) and it was such an enjoyable cup. It was not too acidic, yet strong enough with deep hazelnut and chocolate notes. It had the perfect amount of milk for the strength of coffee. I loved that it was smooth and rich, perfectly for a long sip throughout the afternoon.
If I'm around the area, I'm definitely coming back to Alchemist for a good coffee break!",5
"Had a wonderful time feasting with @doudou.eats and @foodspo.koh at @haeclaypotsg lately, and we loved their prawn claypot � I believe this is the prawn claypot with the most flavourful broth I've tasted so far, and their seafood prawn flavour was so deep � if you like your broth lighter, you can refill with their collagen soup instead � the prawns within the pot were massive as well, and I love how the meat snaps so well when you bite into them!
For the other ingredients, they were all fresh and we loved the Signature Marinated Beef ($9.80) the best. It was really tender and well seasoned too! Their Golden Fungus ($8.80) was interesting as well, as it had a snappy texture and it absorbed the broth well.
If you just like a light meal here, their Hae Mi ($10.80) is quite decent, with 3 large prawns. The pork lard was fresh and the broth used to cook it was flavourful. All it lacked was some bit of wok hei.
All in all, their prawn claypot is a must try if you love your prawn soup! Thank you @haeclaypotsg for inviting �",5
"Found a gem that would make a great lunch spot here in Tai Seng! Hidden among the many food choices in Grantral Mall, @taifengweisg offers many rice and noodle options and they were all pretty excellent �
I had the Fried Pork Chop Shallot Sauce Noodles ($8.40) and the pork chop was just fantastic. It was well fried, not too oily and yet slightly crispy on the outside. The meat was well seasoned, juicy and tender! The noodles were slightly al dente, but the sauce may be a little one dimensional. That can be helped by adding their homemade chilli sauce, which gives so much additional flavours!
But the star of the show is really their wantons. Their Chilli Oil and Vinegar Wantons ($9.40 for 5) may seem expensive, but they came really huge. They were stuffed full of pork and shrimp meat mix, which were seasoned very well. Chilli oil and vinegar just made them even better!
Definitely coming back for more, especially their fried rice. Tried a mouthful from my friend's plate and it was splendid!",4
"Sometimes, even on really sunny days, I will crave for a good stew to fill up not only my stomach, but my heart as well. The Soondubu or Seafood Tofu Stew ($16) from Hoodadak does just that with their flavourful soup and plentiful ingredients. I wouldn't say they are the best, but they are decent enough to come back for more. Seafood is quite fresh, and I do love the egg drop within the stew that made it even more satisfying.
Loved their side dishes as well, as they have about 4 on rotation. This is my go-to Korean food when I'm here in one north!",4
"Finally, clams with huge meat that I can feel and taste! @kallangclaypotlala is one of the new additions to the lala claypot scene, serving up huge clams and flavourful broth. Their clams were very fresh, and their broth was deep but not too salty. We got a variety of ingredients to go with the hotpot, and my favourite was their chunky fish slices, which were flaky and sweet. With many premium ingredients, our bill ranked up to about $130 and it was enough for about 4-5 people. We all find it quite decently priced considering the amount of food we ordered!
Great for the people around the area to bring their friends and families along. Thank you @wantwoeatsg for the invite and @kallangclaypotlala for the food!",5
"Recently back to fuel plus for their delicious food items after some time and I'm happy to report that it's still as good as ever!
The Croffle & Truffle Mushroom ($19) was a total pleasure to have. The moment you have a thick rich truffle sauce and mushrooms, you know there's gonna be loads of umami. The scrambled eggs was done just right, and the Croffle was fluffy, almost like a roti prata!
Next we have the Pesto Eggs with Cajun Shrimp ($20), and being a pesto lover, this was very decent. The pesto eggs were done just right, and complemented well with their homemade sourdough. The shrimps were well grilled, and had a strong smoky flavour which was much appreciated.
Lastly we have the Grilled Seabass (~$25 with side and drink), which was very fresh and well seasoned and grilled. Each piece was very sweet and flaky, and the mashed potato was wonderfully creamy. The truffle tator tots as the side were highly addictive, due to its very crispy exterior.
Definitely no complaints with all the dishes we had, maybe just the long waiting time we had to endure before getting all our food. I'm guessing they might have a shortage of kitchen staff or just not used to large group orders! What's even better is that you can use #burpplebeyond for 30% off their food items! Will be back �",5
"If you haven't heard already, @suukeecoffeesg is known for their delicious taro orh nee toasts, and we went back for their other variations, as well as their lunch fare �
Among the many variations, the one with coconut flakes ($3.80) and with pork floss ($4.20) appealed to me the most, as not only you get a good creamy orh nee flavour, you get more rich coconut flavour from the fresh shavings, and savouriness from the pork floss respectively! Loved the added texture too!
For their lunch fare, the Curry Chicken ($8.50) is one comforting bowl to get. The curry itself is rich yet homely, and the chicken was tender! The potato was well cooked as well. Definitely a meal to give you the needed energy to power through your afternoon. As for their Char Siew Scrambled Egg Rice Bowl ($9.50), it was a good alternative as well, especially with its fluffy egg and tender char siew.
To complement your meal, you must get their Orh Nee Iced Coffee ($4.80), as it was so delicious! The orh nee complemented the strong coffee well, and you can taste both flavours well. It comes with several toppings as well, including taro balls!
Can't wait for my next time to Suu Kee � they do have limited space so do come early if you are here for lunch! Thank you @suukeecoffeesg for the wonderful meal!",5
"Having an omakase course is not only about the quality of the food, but the overall vibes and experience with the chef and hosts. The crew at @dsocialoutcast ticked the checkboxes, with their warm service and delicious food! Their omakase course is unorthodox compared to the usual Japanese style, with many of the menu items focusing on their woodfire grill �
Many of their food items in their 7-course Woodfire Experience ($138) are experimental, with fusion of bold flavours that seem less common! I like how they brought us to many countries just based on the flavours we tasted. They definitely can do a good grill, as their lamb chop was absolutely brilliant, with a smokey yet extremely tender meat!
There is no menu, and their food items change according to chef's mood � there isn't many halal course meals in Singapore, so definitely recommended for everyone to try. Do expect your clothes to smell like the BBQ when you leave, though you can get some perfume fix in their red room � Thank you @burpple for inviting and @dsocialoutcast for the wonderful meal!",4
"I actually have not tried Texan BBQ before and decided to have my first attempt at the popular @kemuribbq.sg and it was decent!
We ordered the Dino Trio Platter ($75), which comes with 2 beef options and 1 other meat which you can choose. The beef brisket had a pretty outstanding smoke ring, which was this smoky crust that was well seasoned. The leaner part of the beef brisket can be slightly dry, but that can be helped with their homemade mustard and BBQ sauce.
Now their Dino Ribs is what I will come back for. The smoke ring on this is much more prominent, and the whole meat was very tender. This was very well seasoned with spices, in fact better than their beef brisket.
The pulled pork was the other meat option we chose, and it can be relatively dry, though the flavour was good.
We ordered additional items, such as their Australian Picanha ($30) which was a popular item. Due to the cut of the meat, it was quite tough and chewy naturally, but the chef did a good job with the seasoning. Mash was creamy and rich, and brussel sprouts were done well. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get the appeal of a rump steak as I liked a cut that is softer.
Truffle fries ($12) were crispy and fluffy, quite decent.
I think Kemuri BBQ is quite decent for their meats, though most were not particularly mind-blowing to me. Not sure if it's because it's my first time, or because I have had high expectations from the videos I've seen of Texas BBQ �",3
"With high ratings on Google, I felt like I needed to try @anhonestcup's coffee and I'm glad that I left happy without any regrets �
Their Iced Latte ($5.50) was an incredibly smooth cup. The coffee itself isn't sharp, but rather mellow yet rich. Nutty chocolate notes were observed and it had just the right amount of milk to pair the espresso shots! Felt like this was quite an affordable cup as well, especially when there's 10% off for healthcare and home team officers.
The ambience of the cafe was very cosy as well, though seating space can be quite limited. Definitely will be back to try their dirty!",5
"If you like your coffee strong, this Dirty Code ($6) fits your palette just right. It came in a pretty sizeable glass, and the coffee itself was strong and aromatic. With quite heavy chocolate notes, it's almost like drinking a very rich mocha! I love how creamy and rich the whole cup was, hence an enjoyable glass to sip. Do note that it can be quite strong at the start as it's mostly the espresso shot you're drinking!
This is one popular cafe along Neil Road, so do prepare to queue abit. One cafe I would consider coming back for!",5
"Among the many high end restaurants and bars located around the area, lies this inconspicuous zi char restaurant that was really pretty decent, while being relatively affordable!
Their Fish Meat Soup ($20 for medium) is one worth commenting on. The soup itself is light, not multidimensional but still decent. What's good is their fish chunks which were huge and fresh! Many pieces were given as well. Love how meaty and flaky the pieces were!
Their Yang Zhou Fried Rice ($15 for medium) came generous and I loved how fluffy the rice was. This has loads of wok hei and charred bits which flavoured the rice well.
The Claypot Bringal with Minced Pork ($18 for medium) was also another dish we liked. Loved how the dish had so much umami flavours and that the bringal was really soft! Best paired with rice.
Prawn Paste Chicken ($15 for medium) was unexpectedly good. Honestly, the colour of the fry was pale and we didn't expect it to be delicious. However, the outer crust was so crispy, and so full of umami flavours! The chicken was well marinated, as the seasoning penetrated the chicken well. Darn addictive!
The Poached Chinese Spinach ($21) is a good vegetable option, as it not only came with salted egg and century egg, it came with flowy poached eggs too � Flavourful but not too salty, this is a good break from all the rich meat dishes.
I wouldn't say that the dishes were particularly mind-blowing, but they were definitely comforting. A zi char restaurant I will come back again for!",4
"When thinking about desserts near Tanjong Pagar, @beansfactory.singapore's quality desserts come to my mind right away. Affordable and delicious, they are my go-to dessert whenever I'm around the area!
The Signature Grass Jelly ($7.90) comes with a variety of ingredients, and one of their best ingredients is their chewy dough (not sure what to call them �)! They were chewy and flavourful and the different coloured ones actually tasted different! I like how it isn't too sweet, even after adding in the milk and black sugar.
The Matcha Beancurd ($7.90) is another good bowl to get, and once again I loved the matcha dough! It had a good matcha fragrance. The sweet red bean was chunky and paired well with the silky beancurd.
Can't wait to be back to try their other variations!",5
"I have been to @sarnies.sg consistently for a couple of years for their dinner fare and I must say that it's been consistently good all these while. One should not judge their cook just by their afternoon brunch fare, as the quality of their dinner items are just so much better.
Their Angus Beef Stew ($26) came in a big plate, with loads of braised beef cubes in a comforting savoury sauce and a huge dollop of mash. I love how tender the beef was, and it was rich with spices. Mash was creamy and buttery!
Next up, their Chicken Parmigiana ($24) is one sharing plate worth ordering. Just look at the amount of cheese on that huge chicken cutlet! It was fried to perfection while keeping the meat tender and juicy inside.
Their Grilled Seabass ($25) is decent. Although the skin wasn't crispy, the meat was still rich, fresh and sweet. Love the char on the brussel sprouts!
They have a promotion where 2 drinks gives you free truffle fries � With that, good food and 1 for 1 dinner mains we got with #burpplebeyond, it's a place you have to go!",5
"If you have cravings for some street snacks and good bingsoos, this is one place to try! Owned by Koreans, their food and dessert items were quite authentic! Here are the items we've had:
Rose Tteobboki ($13.90) - it may look plain, but I loved the cheesy sauce that goes well with the chewy tteok! It had the perfect amount of spice as well.
Cheese Gimbab ($10.90) - this came huge! It had loads of ingredients and all of them tasted fresh. Definitely very homely and comforting. Recommended to share!
Hotteok ($4.90) - although this was very different from the usual hotteok you see in Korea, it was still pretty tasty. It may abit too tough for some, but it was alright for me as I liked its chewiness. It wasn't too sweet as well!
Watermelon Bingsoo ($16.90 for large size) - actually really authentic, pretty close to the ones I've had in Korea. The watermelon balls were quite sweet and juicy, and the shaved ice was very milky!
The gimbab and bingsoo are really worth coming back for � Thank you @foodleaguesg for inviting and @babnbingsoo9 for the delicious food and desserts! Do follow them on Facebook and Instagram for their latest updates!",4
"Recently found a hidden gem for good zi char??
I had a group dinner at West Lake recently, and it was located quite hidden among the older HDBs in Farrer Road. Known for their Kong Ba Pao, it was indeed one of the best renditions I've had. The pork belly slices were braised till they almost fell apart when I tried to pick them up, and they had so much flavour. Neither too salty nor too sweet, the sauce was rich with umami and just perfect for the bun. Talking about that, the bun was so soft and fluffy and especially sweet after chewing it for a while! Definitely a lovely dish to get for sharing. 1 is definitely not satisfying enough for me �
Their Chicken Fried Rice was surprisingly good as well. The rice were in individual grains but not oily, and it had good savoury flavours while the wok hei was subtle. The chicken pieces were tender too! Very lovely.
Their Fried Baby Squid was a joy to have as well, as each baby squid piece was tender and well coated with a light flavourful batter. Best with some beer!
Didn't manage to take a pic of their Beef Hor Fun, but that was satisfying as well, as not only the Hor Fun noodles were cooked perfectly due to its silky smooth texture, the beef slices were flavourful and tender as well. Don't expect great wok hei here, but their dishes were still well executed.
Can't wait to bring my family here! �",5
"If you are looking for good coffee in the heart of town, @nicocafe.sg hits the spot with their quality coffee and aesthetic looks!
We got their Iced Latte ($5.90), and it was an enjoyable cup. The coffee was strong and aromatic, with rich chocolate notes hitting strong. It was quite a big cup, and stayed flavourful towards the end. Their Dirty Coffee ($7.90) was an interesting touch, as it was somewhat sweetened. Coffee notes were nuttier and richer here. Quite smooth as well!
I loved how the cafe has an open concept with beautifully decorated flowers. Definitely perfect if the weather isn't too hot, as you can just chill, have good conversations and do some people watching! I saw that their food items look real good as well, so will be trying them one day �",5
"Recently tried @kyojosg's new summer lunch donburi and it was decent. I had the Chirashi Don ($16) and it came with fresh and plump chunks of sashimi. It had a good mix of salmon, tuna and hamachi, though we felt like the bowls were rather small, perhaps may not be enough for big eaters. You can complete your donburi with $6 set that comes with chawanmushi and miso soup.
They do have a hidden grilled side dish menu, and you can order it via telling the staff ""Himitsu Butayaki"". This is perhaps another Japanese restaurant to consider if you are in town!",3
"Westies, this is for you! If you are looking for some good Korean food, Hoho Korean Restaurant is a splendid choice. I loved everything, from their mains to their side dishes!
Their Seafood Soondubu Stew ($16) came in a big pot and I must say their stew is really one of the most flavourful ones I've had. It had such a rich deep seafood broth flavour and wasn't too spicy. The prawns and clams within were fresh too! A very comforting bowl of stew I don't mind having anytime.
Even their side dishes were good, especially their kimchi! It definitely does not taste commercial, but rather homemade. Loads of dried shrimp flavour within that gave it a good umami.
Feel like this is a hidden gem as it's located deep in sunset way!",5
"@chengdubowl recently launched a series of summer-themed dishes at their Tanjong Pagar flagship store and we tried a couple of them! Many were comforting and we especially fell in love with their Pan Fried Tofu �
The Green Sichuan Pepper Fish ($27.80) had quite chunky pieces which were very soft and tender. The sauce itself was numbing but not too spicy! Note that it comes with a bed of vegetables below.
The Jianghu Spicy Hotpot with Mixed Vegetables ($27.80) was like malatang, but much richer. I loved the beef slices as they were cooked perfectly and were tender. The vegetable ingredients underneath were well cooked and note that it is quite spicy!
The Chongqing Signature Chicken Pot ($27.80) was probably one of my favourites. It was comforting and had a familiar taste, as it was similar to the braised soy sauce chicken you can get around. The chicken pieces were quite tender!
The Fish Flavoured Shrimp Noodles ($15.80) was unfortunately not to our liking, as the taste profile was very sweet due to the tomato sauce. The noodles were too soft too. Maybe this is for the sweet tooth?
Finally, we come to the crowd favourite. The Pan Fried Golden Tofu Cubes ($12.80) were simply addictive. The soft cubes were coated with a thin batter, which remained its crispiness and had a good savoury flavour. Definitely a must order to share!
Overall, the food is decently good and would be a place to consider bringing your friends for a good comforting meal! Thank you @chengdubowl for the meal!",4
"If you are looking for some solid Chendol or Orh Nee, I think the rendition at @hupkafoon really hits the spot.
The Durian Chendol ($5.50) was incredibly rich, with aromatic sweetness coming from the Gula Melaka, and savouriness from the thick coconut milk. Because of this contrast, it is surprisingly not too sweet, but you still get a deep flavour from them! Loved the durian paste as well, as it was very aromatic too. Definitely one of the good variants.
One interesting dessert to get is their Durian Infused Orh Nee ($5.50). With a powerful kick of intense durian flavour, the orh nee taste was rather subtle and instead gave a light earthy aftertaste. We actually liked this alot and would order this again!
The Tang Yuan ($3) was quite standard. Felt like they cooked the dumplings a little too long.
Nonetheless, I will come back here again for their Chendol and Orh Nee!",4
"Recently went to Cafe Gui to get a quick coffee fix, but although it looked good, unfortunately it was decent at most �
The Iced Latte ($6) was topped with milk foam, but sadly the coffee and milk ratio was off. The coffee flavour itself was faint though fragrant and there was just too much milk. I wished it tasted as good as it looked!
Their Signature Dalgona Honeycomb Coffee ($9.90) was also a disappointment, as although the coffee taste was more prominent in this one, the honeycomb tasted burnt. It was sweet but almost bitter! Really not worth the huge price tag as well �
Honestly would skip the coffee here �‍�️",1
"You know sometimes you just want to have a good bowl of noodles to get by your day? Hock Lai Seng's fishball noodle just hits the right spot.
Their $6 bowl of fishball noodles came with a variety of ingredients, from fishballs to meatballs and pork liver. Seeing how they cook, I knew they would do well and I added $1 for extra liver. True enough, their liver slices were very fresh and cooked just right. With a bouncy texture, there isn't much gamey flavour too. The rest of the ingredients were pretty standard and the soup tasted quite old school with a light meat broth.
The noodles were fantastic, with a springy texture and they were well drenched in a mixture of ketchup and their homemade chilli sauce. The savouriness of the chilli sauce shines through with deep umami and a slight kick. Very enjoyable.
Come and try if you're in Maxwell!",5
"If you are looking for an affordable option in town with pretty decent food, this is one place to go! @minchengbibimbap just opened an outlet in Funan Mall offering Korean Chinese fare.
We had the Cheese Beef Bibimbap ($9.80), which was just satisfying. Mixing in the generous amount of cheese with the Bibimbap sauce at the side, each bite of the mixed rice provides a comforting familiar flavour with some richness from the cheese. Due to the stone pot, the bottom rice gets charred abit and the charred rice was quite satisfying to chew!
The Angus Marbled Beef ($12.80) was also a delicious bowl, as the beef was tender and braised in a comforting sweet savoury sauce. It also comes with Enoki mushroom and chewy glass noodles!
As for sides, the Hot Plate Squid ($11.80) is a good choice if you like savoury flavours, as it reminds me of a good Chinese BBQ with its cumin flavours. The squid itself is also tender!
Unfortunately, the Braised Pork Bibimbap ($6.80) was not to our liking. The five spice flavour was too strong and it was too bland.
All dishes come with free flow kimchi, soup and rice. Most of the dishes were still hits for us. Decent and affordable fare! Thank you @minchengbibimbap for inviting us!",4
"One of the more popular cafes in the region, @asylumcoffeesg don't mess around with their coffee. I had their Iced Latte ($7.50) and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality cuppa I was having.
Although it was a smaller cup as compared to other cafes, the coffee was strong, yet very smooth and fragrant. Chocolate nutty notes were evident, and they put the right amount of milk for the coffee. Love how it was rich and creamy, all the way till the end. Very enjoyable!
Their cafe isn't big, but some outside seats were available. I saw many people getting their filter coffee and coffee beans itself, so this further emphasises how much people love the coffee here!",5
"If you are looking for an affordable yet decent ramen, @suparakkiramen offers just that! Glad that they opened a new outlet in Pasir Ris Mall, closer to home.
The Supa Signature Ramen goes for just $8.90, and it was value for money. The Tonkotsu broth may not be the best or the richest compared to the ones from Japan, but it is still decent. You can taste the pork bones used and it was still flavourful. The char siew might be a little tough, but it was packed with flavour. The shoyu egg was done well as the egg yolk had the perfect consistency! The Soft Shell Crab Ramen ($12.90) was similar, just with a mix of fish broth and a crispy soft shell crab. It was alright, but better if the the crab was served by the side!
My favourite was actually the Dry Truffle Ramen ($7.90) which was just fantastic for its price. The noodles were very springy and were well coated with truffle oil and other sauces used. The pork meat served was also very flavourful and had a good mix of sweet and savoury flavours.
You can top up for a side and a drink, and the gyoza and ebi fry we had were decent too. Definitely a meal option to check out! Thank you @wanwaiwen for the invite and @suparakkiramen for the food!",4
"I tried the newly opened Wang Omakase, and while I find it to be decent, there are some areas that can be improved � Seafood used are all very fresh and have much umami flavour, but their shari, or sushi rice, can be just a little softer. There were some repetitions of ingredients used. Portion wise, this may not be enough for larger appetites. That being said, it is still a treat for your palette and good if you are going for a more casual style omakase. Loads of potential!",3
"Pasir Ris residents or even easties, there's another dish in the new Pasir Ris Mall worth trying out. Kawan Bowl in Cantine by Kopitiam serves up Halal egg rice bowls that are similar to the famous ones from Dan Lao, but with a more local twist that is pretty darn good!
The Ayam Panggang Egg Rice ($6.90) boasts a huge slab of grilled chicken, that had a beautiful char and flavour. I can tell that the marinade penetrated the chicken well, as it was flavourful throughout the chicken cutlet. As Malay spices were used, you know it's all about rich deep flavours. The char from the grilling added extra umami as well! The sauce used is of a good mix of sweet and savoury flavours. The egg itself was fluffy and done well � My only nitpick is that I wish the rice was flavoured � but yeah all rice bowls usually use the normal rice.
The Satay Goreng Chicken Egg Rice ($7.90) was using the same chicken but with spicy peanut sauce. If you love peanut sauce, this is up your alley. I just found the sauce too rich and covered up the taste of the chicken marinade.
Definitely recommend the Ayam Panggang as I can wolf down 2 bowls no problem �",4
"Tried @acidbarsg for the first time and I think although there were some misses, the dishes that were good were wonderful � with live bands and happy hour promotions, this would be a good place for dinner and drinks with friends!
The Spice Route Chicken ($30) may take some time to prepare, but it was a worthwhile wait. The chicken was very well marinated and roasted, and it had a slight char to the skin. The meat was very tender and succulent. Loved the spice rub, as the chicken was packed with flavour!
The Otah Otah Fried Rice ($24) was addictive. Fragrant and packed with flavour, it was moderately spicy and I loved the addition of Sakura Ebi!
If you are looking for some bar food, the Kang Kong Keras ($16) hits the spot. A generous bowl of fried Kang Kong was given, and it was addictive due to its crispy exterior. Perfect with the Thai chilli sauce given.
The Rickshaw Noodles ($18) was unfortunately forgettable, as it generally lacked flavour. Truffle Fries ($16) was decent, nothing much to shout out about.
Generally a good central location to meet for good drinks and food.",4
"If you're around the area in Bedok Reservoir and would like a good coffee, @bench.barista.sg has just that!
I tried their Iced Latte ($4.90) and their Bench Signature Iced Latte ($6.20) and as I usually like my coffee unsweetened, the Iced Latte satisfied my coffee cravings. The Iced Latte was fragrant and smooth, and as the beans used were medium roast, it was not too acidic and you can taste some chocolate notes as well. Mixing well, it may not have a strong coffee kick, but it tasted like a warm embrace around your tongue.
The Bench Signature Iced Latte was an Iced Latte sweetened with pecan praline syrup. It definitely added an extra nuttiness to the coffee, but it was a tad too sweet for me. Not bad though!
There isn't much seating space here, so it's mainly a takeaway kiosk. If I am staying around the area, I can imagine myself coming down to grab a quick coffee! Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers for the invite and Bench Bistro for the coffee!",4
"Straight up, there were hits and misses, but can come back for their pork belly, chicken chop and sweet potato.
We ordered the Beef Brisket platter ($36) and Duck Platter ($32) which came with various types of meats, including their pork belly and chicken chop. Among the meats, their pork belly was our crowd favourite, due to its heavy smoky flavour, slight crust on the outside and their melt-in-the-mouth fats. It was well seasoned as well, but can be really rich � Their chicken chop is also our favourite, as it was smoky, tender and flavourful. Definitely went well with the cream sauce!
However, both the duck leg and beef brisket did not sit well with us, as the duck leg lacked flavour in general and the beef brisket lacked its essential beefy flavour. There was way too much fat to meat ratio too.
As for the sides, the sweet potato won us with its crispy exterior, fluffy inside and it was also well seasoned! The mashed potato and ratatouille were okay but the aglio olio lacked flavour and was under seasoned. Aside from the platters we also ordered another Cream Carbonara but it was rather flat tasting as all we tasted was cream.
All in all, I don't think it warrants a long distance trip as it can be quite hard to get to, but if you are nearby, get their pork belly or chicken chop with sweet potatoes as the side! It was pretty affordable too!",4
"Found another cafe that is quite worth going to if you have #burpplebeyond ! It's a pretty large space but somehow was almost empty when I was there for a weekday dinner...
The Baked Salmon with Mentaiko Pasta ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was pretty good overall, with the salmon being exceptionally well executed. It was a big slice, and was very well marinated. It was very tender, not overcooked at all and fresh. The pasta itself was okay, can get quite surfeiting towards the end.
I also got a Flat Iron Steak ($29 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and it was moderately tender (probably due to the cut of the meat) and pretty juicy and beefy. It was slightly under seasoned, nothing a side of salt and pepper can't solve. Not bad, can try but I would get something else next time.
Their Crispy Brussel Sprouts ($14) was a huge bowl, and it wasn't too salty. It wasn't too bitter either and I could taste some natural sweetness in the aftertaste!
I think this place is quite worth with the usage of #burpplebeyond, although I probably wouldn't come here without it. Definitely a can try!",5
"If you love your coffee, this is one place you ought to go. With numerous bean choices to choose from, @20gramscoffeesg offers quality coffee to sip the afternoon away!
We got a White Cold Brew ($8) and an Iced Milk Espresso ($7). The White Cold Brew is definitely a stronger brew, with chocolate notes coming through quite strongly. It was very rich and did not get diluted all the way till the end. The Iced Milk Espresso was more interesting, as the beans used here are more fruity and acidic. Sour notes are evident, and quite aromatic as well! However, I do feel like such fruity bean choices should be better drunk without milk.
Definitely a place for people who know their coffee! Most people there seem to drink their coffee black or filtered!",4
"Back at @kookscreamery for their desserts and noticed that they now have lava waffles! Tried it but felt like we should still stick with their lava cookie and gelato �
The Matcha Lava Waffles we ordered were unfortunately too soft? There was not crisp to the waffle and it seemed cold. The matcha cream had some matcha flavour and was pretty sweet. We got the Dirty Matcha with the waffles, and it was pretty good. You get a slight earthy flavour with a hint of coffee flavour. Wished that it was less sweet though!
We also got another Chocolate Lava Cookie, which was as good as always. Dark rich chocolate ganache with soft buttery cookie; this is hard to go wrong. With the cookie we got a Pistachio and Black Sesame gelato. The Pistachio was fine with its creamy nuttiness, but the black sesame SLAPPED SO HARD. The black sesame flavour was so strong yet so aromatic and it had the right amount of sweetness and earthiness. So lovely I wished I ordered another scoop!
The total bill was about $33, which was kind of pricey. Nonetheless, I will still see myself back to try more of their gelato with lava cookie!",4
"Woodlands Claypot Prawn Hotpot recently opened an outlet in the east, serving up the same menu as the original one in Marsiling.
The soup base is similar to the original outlet, with the Singapore prawn noodles profile, just abit more peppery. The prawns were fresh and pretty huge as well. With a variety of ingredients to choose from for the hotpot, we find their meat slices and seafood pastes much better than their other hotpot choices. Both the pork and beef slices were very tender and fatty. Prawn paste had a good bite and strong prawn flavour too!
The best finish for the meal is really the instant noodles, as they soak up the soup well. A good tip is to peel the prawns at the start and throw the heads back to the boiling broth to make it more flavourful!
Thank you @wantwoeatsg for inviting and @woodlandsclaypotprawn_tampines for the food!",4
"ORH NEE WAFFLES?? As Orh Nee lovers, we had to try @creme_sg 's rendition. Overall, we gave the waffles a thumbs up, and the gelato flavours are just alright.
The Orh Nee Waffles were crispy on the outside, and really fluffy within. We love how there was a substantial amount of orh nee cream, and that it was rich and quite full of orh nee and coconut flavour! This was very fragrant and addictive and can be eaten on its own.
The gelato flavours were good, but just nothing to shout out about. The Sugarless Chocolate was indeed very dark and rich, with some brownie bits within. The Raspberry Blueberry Oatmilk was very fruity and tangy, but the texture was a little strange as it was especially sticky. Felt like both gelato flavours were abit too sweet.
Total price was about $16. Honestly, I would definitely go back for their waffles and stick to their chrysanthemum goji gelato flavour! That one was good �",4
"Had such a great experience at @bullockcart.coffee that day, with their cosy ambience, friendly conversations with the owners and delicious coffee.
Iced Yam Latte ($6.50) is uncommon and I'm glad that they have it. The yam taste isn't too artificial, wasn't too strong and complemented the coffee very well. You taste the rich notes of the coffee first, before getting a sweet earthy flavour of the yam. Doesn't get too diluted towards the end too!
If you are a coffee lover, I suggest asking for their Ethiopian beans for their Iced Latte ($5.50). It was strong, fragrant and the right amount of acidity. Definitely rich and enjoyable.
They don't really have seats with big tables here, so this place is a great place to just come and chill and have conversations with small parties. Definitely will be back for their quality coffee and friendly owners.",5
"Now this is what I call restaurant quality food in a hawker setting. This is my 2nd time at Eddy's and it is still as good ���
The Duck Confit with Aglio Olio ($14) was absolutely splendid. The duck confit itself was quite sizable, and it was perfectly grilled to have an amazing crispy skin, while keeping the meat within moist. It was incredibly tender, as you can pull apart the meat with a plastic spoon! It was well flavoured as well with their secret blend of spices. Aglio Olio was great as well, as it was al dente and very garlicky �
Even their Grilled Salmon with Mashed Potato ($12) was very good. The salmon skin was grilled till very crispy and the meat was pretty moist! Loved that the salmon was quite fatty. The mashed potato below was rich and creamy, exactly how it should be.
This is one hawker stall I will crave and I will definitely be back! I believe the duck confit here is worth travelling for, as I dare say that it's better than many restaurants I've been to.",5
"Absolutely fell in love with @coldbreak_sg 's Nian Gao Waffle, their quality gelato flavours and their chill ambience! We got their waffles with 3 scoops of gelato and I just wanted more �
Let's go straight to their Nian Gao Pandan Waffle as it is what most people are hyped up about. There was a pretty huge piece of nian gao in the middle of the waffle, which gave it a beautiful chewy centre � the exterior of the waffle was mostly crispy and the fragrance of the pandan was inviting. Absolutely lovely.
The White Chrysanthemum Goji gelato was of high standards. The taste of chrysanthemum was strong and aromatic, and I loved how it wasn't too sweet! The Osmanthus Mango Passionfruit was so refreshing. Although the taste of osmanthus is quite subtle, the citrus flavour was addictive. I can eat a tub of this in one sitting! The Pistachio was creamy, nutty and very smooth.
The total bill was $19, which isn't too bad. Definitely will be back for the waffles and to try out other gelato flavours!",5
"Had a wonderful time trying out some of the new and popular dishes at Good Bites @goodbitessg and really liked many of them � Here are my favourites:
Prawn Pesto Pasta - if you love your pesto, this rendition is a good one. The taste of basil is strong yet not overpowering, and it was greatly enhanced by the umami coming from the sauteed garlic and onions. Pasta was al dente, prawns were plump and snappy. I thoroughly enjoyed this!
Beef Lasagna - been some time since I've had lasagna, and this reminded me how much I've missed it. It was very cheesy, stuffed full of minced meat and the pasta was also still rather al dente! The tomato sauce had the right balance between sweet and savoury too. However it can get quite rich, so best to share.
Strawberry Osmanthus Earl Grey Tea - this is one good refreshing choice. All flavours within the tea complemented each other well, and loved the whipped cream on top! This is no canned whipped cream; I could tell that it's made in house using fresh cream and it's a good contrast to the refreshing tea below.
With quite a few tables, this is one place to gather with your friends for meals! It's halal certified too � Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting and @goodbitessg for the food! Had such a lovely time �",4
"A hole in the wall noodle joint, A9 noodle serves up multiple variations of their handmade noodles and dumplings as well. Noodles were decent, prices were very affordable and I can see why people come here for no frills meals!
I got the Beef Savoury Noodle ($5) which came with quite a substantial amount of handmade noodles. They were lightly coated with some flavoured oil, garlic and onions. The noodles were slightly springy and had loads of flavour from the sauce. Do add a dash of their chilli oil but be warned, it's pretty spicy! The heat and the umami of the chilli oil does elevate the flavours of the noodles. Beef slices were okay, nothing much to shout out about.
Their Chive Pork Dumplings were incredibly cheap at just $4 for 15. Pretty decent, the skin wasn't too thick and the meat to skin ratio was substantial.
Not a place I would travel all the way for, but I can see myself coming here for lunch if I work around the area. A good simple meal! Please note that it's a one man show so you probably need to wait abit for your food. The uncle was pretty nice though!",3
"We had a wonderful time at @jinho.galaxis, an izakaya style bar with quality food options to accompany the alcohol we were having. All dishes were executed well and it was hard to choose my favourites! The most memorable ones were these:
Grilled Gyu Steak ($20) - this was one tender juicy steak that was perfect with the ponzu sauce. The fried garlic pieces were so umami tasting! The sauteed onions were fun to munch on with some beer �
Asari Batayai ($11) - now this is perfect for any occasion. The garlic and butter broth was so rich and umami tasting, with a chilli spice coming after quite strongly. The clams were fresh and had a great chewy texture!
Kawaebi ($8) - super addictive, these mini shrimps were packed with umami and were very crispy. Honestly this makes the perfect beer food and we had to order seconds!
All dishes were delicious, but just to note is that it can be quite pricey. I definitely had a good night of food and drinks!",4
"When I think of a good cup of Iced Latte, one of them has to be the Iced Magic ($6) from ae Coffee. With the right amount of milk, the fragrance of the coffee comes out strongly without being too sharp. I got the Heavyweight beans, which had the chocolate notes that were greatly appreciated.
Do note that there are no seats at this coffee stand, so it's probably takeaway only. If I were to work nearby, this is definitely a good coffee I will want to takeaway for some post lunch perk me up!",4
"Heard alot about the Chinese food here at @myorestobar and had a chance to try a variety of their dishes � I must say that overall, the food quality here is really good and definitely fit for family meals and gatherings! Here are my favourites:
The Kia Hiang Claypot Spring Chicken ($26) is their speciality and I can see why. The chicken itself was incredibly tender and all drenched in a sweet savoury sauce that had a deep herbal flavour as well. The cabbage is cooked till really soft as well. Really comforting dish I don't mind having again.
Garoupa Fillet in Claypot with Garlic and Ginger ($22/30/38) - this dish was kept very simple, yet incredibly well executed. The fish slices had a firm bite and were tender; they were lightly seasoned by the sauce which had simple garlic and ginger flavours. Once again another comforting dish.
Crispy Yam Bag with Scallops ($5.50 each) - yes they may be expensive but once again this is one dish executed well. Really crispy exterior with soft creamy yam paste and snappy scallop, the contrast in texture was well appreciated.
It can be quite pricey, but still, a solid place to bring your family for celebratory meals!",4
"One sip of their prawn broth and I was sold � @woodlandsclaypotprawn offers prawn claypot hotpot with multiple ingredients to add on and we loved them all!
Upon ordering the Speciality Prawn Broth ($32.80), you will be greeted by a raging charcoal fire and a claypot full of huge prawns! We counted at least 12 pieces which made this really worth it � the broth itself was familiar, with a taste similar to those from the prawn mee soup. It was very rich with prawn flavours and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The add on ingredients that we ordered were all fresh and I especially loved the shabu pork slices, as they were thicker than other places and yet still tender. Their prawn paste doesn't disappoint as well!
They do provide a variety of sauces, although the classic sesame sauce with garlic would suffice.
We also tried their Hokkien Mee ($8.80) which was well executed too. It was very interesting to see a raw egg for you to mix it, which adds extra richness and binds the whole dish very well. Seafood and meat flavours were strong in the broth and I absolutely loved their fresh pork lard! This is a very wet starchy version which some will love.
Now this is one meal I will crave on rainy days and I would definitely come back. Thank you @wantwoeatsg for inviting and @woodlandsclaypotprawn for the food!",5
"If you are near the one-north area, this is one decent place to consider for a more upscale dining experience. We had a selection of dishes and here are my favourites:
Signature Classic Roast Duck (whole - $58.80): I can see why this is their signature, as the sauce here was fantastic. It had a nice blend of sweet and savoury flavours, coupled with strong herbal notes. This is one sauce I wanna mop up with rice! The duck itself was tender, the skin was crispy but my only gripe was that it was rather skinny, so most parts didn't have much meat.
Speciality Pineapple Prawns ($32): it came with a nice presentation and it tasted as good as it looked. The plump prawns were drenched in a sweet sauce that was pretty refreshing!
Dual Style Hor Fun ($16.80): the hor fun noodles were silky smooth and had a nice bite! Loved that it had the wok hei flavour too. The fried hor fun noodles were also fresh and the crispy texture went so well with the silky noodles.
The rest of the dishes were decent at best. Thank you @burpple for inviting and thank you @wokpalacesg for the food!",4
"If you are in need of some good desserts, @yatkayan is one place to go to satisfy your cravings. With a huge selection, we were spoilt for choice!
After some deliberation, we settled with our favourite Orh Ni or Yam Paste ($5.80) and Cold MSW Durian Mousse ($7.80). The Yam Paste was very thick, rich and creamy, exactly how a good orh ni should be! It came with a good number of gingko nuts, great if you love them. I love how the coconut milk added extra creaminess and flavour, but this means that it can get surfeiting towards the end �
As for the durian mousse, this is definitely approved by the durian lover aka me. It was very rich and creamy, and I loved the huge slab of durian meat which was bittersweet! Quite a big portion for $7.80 and once again, better shared with others! My only nitpick is that it's not cold enough, wished that it was mixed with some crushed ice.
With their quality dessert and huge selections, definitely coming back again!",5
"Finally tried Aburi Kaisen Don Keisuke, and I must say that the sauce for their don and mazesoba was fantastic, but their aburi sashimi were at most decent.
The Warayaki Aburi Kaisen Mazesoba ($16.90) was probably the dream of most dry noodle lovers. At a sizeable portion, the noodles were really al dente and the beautiful sweet savoury sauce had so much umami. Each strand of noodle was really coated well with the sauce. Honestly, just give me a bowl of their noodles and sauce and I will be a happy man. The Aburi sashimi pieces were actually quite forgettable unfortunately.
The premium don version ($22.90) was also well flavoured by the sauce, but perhaps it was slightly too salty. Once again the Aburi pieces were just decent, so I wouldn't think it was worth the premium upgrade. If you love your seafood soup, the lobster broth of the ochazuke set ($4) is well worth the top up as the soup was simply fantastic with the seafood flavours. Very rich, they go very well with the rice and sauce.
I would think this is a decent place to come if you're around the area!",4
"Found a gem in the heart of Chinatown! Just a few steps away from the 2nd level of Hong Lim Complex, lies @springcoffee.sg , a lovely quaint cafe good for coffee and conversations.
We had their new Strawberry Matcha ($8.50) and I must say it was quite refreshing! Do give it a good stir, and you will feel like the matcha and strawberry flavours complement well together. We like the homemade strawberry jam below, as it came with several very soft pieces of strawberry that isn't too sweet. A very pretty drink indeed!
I love a good coffee, and their Iced Latte ($5.50) is one worth to come back for. It had the right amount of milk, and I like how strong and nutty the coffee was such that it does not get diluted towards the end. Definitely a smooth cup of coffee I would love to have again!
Will be back again once I'm around the area!",5
"If you are looking for a good quality Korean BBQ, I really think you no need to look further as our experience at @o.bba_bbq_jjajang_amoy @o.bba_sg was really fantastic �
The Best Set ($68) was very much good for 2, as it came with 2 huge slabs of wet aged pork belly and a soybean stew. The wet aged pork belly was just phenomenal, as our server cooked it perfectly; it was nicely charred and crispy on the outside, and the inside was just so tender and juicy. It had a very clean taste and was really as good if not better than the fresh pork belly I've had in Korea.
The Soybean Stew was comforting and came with loads of seafood ingredients and tofu. Not too salty and you get a rich umami taste too!
One item you need to get at Obba is their Flying Fish Roe with Rice ($14). It was so nicely flavoured with seafood umami coming from the roe and seaweed! Definitely a great carb to have together with your BBQ.
The side dishes here were also superior as compared to other places. The kimchi was very fresh and crunchy, they have tteokbokki as their sides that day (no need to order separately �) and the egg rolls were done very well!
From the food to the service, everything was just wonderful. Can't wait to come back to obba again!",5
"This is one dessert I will come back under the current sweltering heat �‍� @bingduoduosg serves up several shaved ice desserts and we got the Mango Durian ($8.80) one.
The mango pieces were decently sweet, but the star of the show got to be the durian. It was a big scoop of pure durian flesh, that was so aromatic with incredibly rich flavours. Not sure what kind of durian they used, but it sure is a delicious one!
The shaved ice had some condensed milk within, but do take note that it's quite coarse. If you like to bite on ice, this is for you. If not I don't think it's something you will enjoy too much!
Definitely coming back for their pure durian dessert �",4
"Back at @kouhaku.omakase for their dinner sushi omakase ($108) and it was even better than the last time I had it � there was a good variety of both cooked dishes and sashimi and I especially loved the Fugu Kaarage served! It is rare to have pufferfish served as it takes many years to train a chef to serve this delicacy.
All dishes served were fantastic, especially the Fatty Tuna Belly Sashimi and A5 Wagyu Tendon Braised Stew ($19) that we added on. The fatty tuna belly just melted in my mouth and was really rich. The beef in the stew was so tender and very beefy � very addictive!
The atmosphere was posh and the chefs were all very lively. At such a price, I really think this is one of the most value for money omakase sets as you get to be served by a Japanese chef and you get pretty high quality ingredients. We were all pretty stuffed towards the end!
If you are looking for a celebration, this is a place to go for �",5
"Tried @thaipanrestaurant recently and overall had a pretty decent experience! This restaurant is known among VJC students as it used to open nearby and have fed quite a number of batches � most dishes were hits and here are ones I would like to mention:
Thaipan Jade Tofu with Chicken Floss ($14.80) - this unassuming tofu dish turned out to be my favourite! Loved the crispy crust and the soft interior, coupled with the sweet savoury combination provided by the chicken floss and drizzled sauce. Actually pretty addictive!
Hong Kong Fried Noodle ($14.50 for large) - I don't usually like these kind of noodle dish as most places don't do it well but I am happy to report that this rendition is banging! ✨ Savoury flavours were strong and there was a touch of wok hei. Noodles were al dente and there were loads of ingredients within!
Butter Squid ($18) - now this is one of the famous dishes, but it didn't quite sit with me � the butter sauce was kinda clumpy and I was wondering if they overcooked the milk within. The squid was pretty fresh still though!
Nonetheless, most dishes were delicious and I would come back if I'm around the area.",4
"Had such a good meal at @sushirosingapore lately, with many new dishes that are unique to their latest outlet at @tasteorchard. I think they need no introduction, with their snaking queues in other outlets. We had such a variety and here are my favourites:
Torched Soy Sauce Giant Scallop ($4.50) - the scallop given was so huge, thick and succulent � I love the smoky flavour that complemented well with its sweet meaty flesh!
Whitebait Mix Noodles ($8.50) - now this is a refreshing dish to share. The tanginess of the lemon complemented very well with its savoury sauce. Loved the chewy noodles!
Bluefin Fatty Tuna ($4.90) - how can anyone not fall in love with this classic? The tuna itself was glistening and it really melted in my mouth. Perfect with a bit of wasabi and soy sauce � definitely very rich!
Congratulations Sushiro on your new outlet! Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting �",5
"Finally tried @apartmentcoffee and I loved both the coffee and vibes at this chill cafe!
I had a simple Iced Latte ($6.50) which had strong aromatic notes and it was abit fruity even. Just the right amount of milk, this was an enjoyable cup! The ceramic cup given was also really pretty.
I like how they have a good number of art pieces around that added to the chill vibes they provided! Really does make you feel relaxed.
This is quite a popular cafe, so do note that they limit dining time to about an hour! This is still good for a short chill conversation with your loved ones, or short pause from your daily activities.
Will be back when I'm around in the area!",4
"It's been some time since I've been to Chomp Chomp Food Centre, and I feel like the prices have risen quite a bit since � wonder if it's because it has become much more touristy that before � Nonetheless, the food here is still pretty good! Here's what I've got:
Hokkien Mee ($5 medium portion) from Chia Keng Fried Hokkien Mee - many people don't seem to stand by this, but this portion we had was delicious! The portion may be smaller than usual, but it was packed with seafood flavour with every bite. There wasn't much alkaline flavour and it was starchy in a nice way. Prawns were a miss but the pork lard pieces were just glorious with the noodles �
Sambal Stingray ($20 medium portion) from Hai Wei Yuan - may be expensive, but they did give quite meaty pieces. There was little fishy odour and the meat was flaky, juicy and smoky! Sambal was not really spicy, but flavourful. Good enough to share among 3!
Oyster Omelette ($9 medium portion) from Ang Sa Lee - quite decent, the oysters were plump and fresh and there was alot more egg than flour in this rendition! Chilli was okay, just wished it was more savoury.
Pork and Chicken Satay and Chicken Wings from Traditional Hai Nam Fang - now these stole our hearts � the satay meat were so smoky, flavourful and tender � perfect with the peanut pineapple satay sauce given. The chicken wings were also well flavourful and smoky too! Definitely a good sharing dish here!
Somehow drinks are in enormous portions � this can be a place to consider having a good dinner with friends! Although it can be abit inconvenient to get to �",5
"Now this is a hidden dessert gem everyone should know! Just right outside the food republic vivocity lies @little_creamery , a humble gelato shop selling really great waffles with delicious gelato flavours.
We had the Nian Gao Waffles with Houjicha Mochi and Ube gelato ($15) and they made us so happy � the Nian Gao Waffles had the most wonderful crisp exterior, yet revealing a soft chewy interior within. The buttery taste of the waffle was very inviting too! We both agreed that it was one of the best gelato waffles we've had! There was quite a bit of Nian Gao within too.
Now to the gelatos, the Houjicha Mochi gelato was very rich in aromatic roasted green tea flavour. It wasn't too sweet and in fact you can taste the bitterness towards the end! There was quite abit of mochi within too! Our only concern was that it was quite grainy.
The Ube flavour was very natural tasting, with aromatic sweet potato flavours coming in quite smoothly. I like how it was creamy and paired with the waffles well �
Thank you @wantwoeatsg for inviting and @little_creamery for the wonderful waffles and gelato � This will be our dessert place whenever we are here in Vivocity!",5
"As you can tell, I really love my ice cream � desserts are important in my gatherings with friends and I'm glad to be back at one of my favourite ice cream shops!
We had the gelato and waffles at @smittenicecreambar and we were all impressed by their flavours, with their Mao Shang Wang ice cream being the best. It may be a more expensive scoop, but it was filled with alot of durian meat. It was really fragrant and strong, just like how I would like my durian gelato to be!
The Artisan Chocolate also won our hearts. With a rich decadent flavour, it was not too sweet with a very smooth texture. This is one gelato for chocolate lovers! The Biscoff flavour was also not bad, but definitely lighter than the other 2 flavours we've got.
The waffle was very crispy, quite decent.
Definitely will be back!",5
"Finally visited this recently famous ramen restaurant, @ramenya0103 that really makes you feel like you're in Japan! With just 8 seats in a tight space, expect long queues and waiting times. I queued for 1.5 hours at about 7.30pm on a weekday afternoon �
I got the Tonkotsu Ramen Black ($12.80) which I felt was quite affordable with quite a few pieces of char siu. The main star of the show got to be the broth, as it was extremely thick (almost like a sauce) and it had so much umami flavours while not being too salty. We all agreed that we can definitely drink alot of the soup! Love that the garlic oil added extra umami as well. The noodles were alright, quite al dente. Char Siu was very tender and flavourful!
Definitely a great bowl of ramen, but really does not warrant the 1.5 hour wait. 30 minutes is the maximum I will wait for this!",4
"If you are looking for some quality buffet, I think @tunglokgroup 's dim sum lunch buffet might tick your checkboxes! The lunch buffet is priced quite affordably at $43.80++, considering the fact that a portion of chilli crabs is served with the unlimited portions of zichar dishes and dim sum you can order. Here are some of my favourite dishes:
Chilli Crabs - the crabs given were pretty huge and meaty, and the sauce was just fantastic � there was loads of egg within and it was sweet and savoury enough! Best paired with their mantou hoho
Salmon Sashimi - the buffet includes free flow salmon sashimi too! It's fresh but not the best. It was rather fatty and still decent.
Char Siu Puff - this was so addictive � the puff pastry was very flaky, and I just loved the savoury char siu within. There was no pork odour and the sauce just complemented the pork floss on top so well.
Char Siu Bao - this is a classic dim sum done well. The char siu, as mentioned earlier, was flavourful and I loved the sweet fluffy dough that is hard to replicate. Meat to bun ratio was just right!
Now this is a place good enough to bring your family for a meal or a celebration �",4
"Finally tried @danlao_sg 's Large Fried Chicken bowl ($7) at Tampines Mall outlet and I was sold �
At first look, the fried chicken cutlet given was pretty huge! The batter was light, crispy and flavourful and the best part was that the chicken within was still substantially thick and juicy � very addictive!
Now for the egg, this is what they are famous for. It was done just right, fluffy and flavourful with their signature sauce drizzled on top.
Combining all the elements together with the bed of rice below, this is one satisfying meal that will fill you up! Will be back �",5
"If you love your bakes, pastries and coffee, this is one cafe to go! @keongsaikbakery serves up delicious bakes and coffee in both traditional western forms so it should fit most tasting palettes!
For bakes, we got the Orh Nee Tart ($8.80) and Chocolate Indulgence ($8.80) that is both available 1 for 1 under #burpplebeyond and they were good! The Orh Nee Tart was satisfying as the paste had strong coconut flavours and was very smooth! There was so much paste on the tart which made it really rich � just felt like the tart crust could have been fresher though!
The Chocolate Indulgence lived up to its name as it was decadent with its good quality chocolate flavours. Definitely very rich and perfect for chocolate lovers. We felt like the sponge cake was abit too dry too.
To accompany the bakes, their Iced Latte with Arabica beans ($6) is a good option. It was smooth, rich yet not too milky. The coffee notes were strong and the nutty profile was delightful!
Definitely a good place to just chill with your friends and loved ones �",4
"Now this is one hidden gem in town you need to go to! Despite being located just a stone throw away from orchard central, the prices, quality and portions were all really good � Here were some of my favourites:
Deep Fried Chicken with Garlic ($8.50) - this is one of the best renditions I've had from a Thai restaurant. The batter was light and crispy, and the chicken inside stayed really moist and flavourful. This was extremely addictive �
Deep Fried Sliced Fish with Sweet and Sour Sauce ($16) - the fish slices were flaky and super crispy � absolutely loved the sauce as it was tangy, making it not too surfeiting. A very good dish to order to share!
Olive Fried Rice ($8.50) - I loved how the rice was not clumpy and filled with savoury fermented olive flavour and some smokiness. The portion was pretty huge so you can order this to share!
All the dishes ordered were hits � I can't believe I only know of this place now! Definitely coming back to try other dishes �",5
"Found surprisingly decent ramen all the way at Changi City Point! All dishes served were all quite good!
The Black Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen Set ($16.90) came with slurp worthy bowl of rich broth ramen with a side dish and a drink. The black garlic broth was very rich with umami and savoury pork broth flavours and the noodles were rather al dente, just slightly too soft for my liking. The Cha Shu was alright, could be softer!
For side dishes, there were a few choices and we got the kaarage and gyoza. The Kaarage pieces were quite meaty, with a crispy exterior and rather juicy interior! The gyoza pieces were not bad as well, just that the meat filling had quite abit of ginger such that you can taste it quite strongly!
Decent ramen for a meal if you happen to be here!",4
"Straight up, this is one of the best waffles and gelato I've had! All the flavours we had were hits and the waffle was chef kiss ✌️
We had 4 flavours of gelato, with the Houjicha Mochi being the best. It was strong, fragrant and yet not too sweet. Loved the roasted tea taste! There wasn't much mochi, but if you find it, it would be a pleasant surprise �
The Ca Phe, or Vietnamese Coffee, was straight up rich with a strong coffee kick. Absolutely loved this, as you can taste the condensed milk as well. The Honey Chrysanthemum was also very fragrant with the chrysanthemum flavour not coming out too strong. One of the best renditions of such flavour actually! Rocher was rich with both chocolate and hazelnut flavours.
Now to the star of the show, their Coconut Pandan Waffles. Extremely crispy on the outside, there was this loud crunch as you cut into it. What's even better is that it is amazingly chewy within! This is quite amazing, considering there is no actual mochi inside. Both coconut and pandan flavours were strong too!
Their gelato and waffles can be abit expensive, as 2 double scoop waffles amounted to $38. However, I am still gonna come back to try more flavours!",5
"Everyone, @isshinmachi_sg is officially one of my go-to place for good noodles and Taiwanese food now � We ordered a variety of dishes and many of them were BIG hits!
The Pork Wanton Noodles with Guan Miao Noodles ($13) was absolutely fantastic. The noodles were chewy, yet so easy to slurp � really one of the best noodle textures I've had. The sauce was also not too salty and best paired with some chilli oil that you can ask from them! Wanton pieces were also very plump and meaty.
The Crispy Chicken Cutlet ($9.80) was one of the best renditions I've had in the Taiwanese restaurants I've been to in Singapore. Light and crispy crust, juicy yet tender meat, flavourful all the way through. Absolutely lovely.
Three Cups Squid ($16.90) came in a rather generous portion, with numerous fresh squid slices. The best part is actually the sauce here, as it had a beautiful combination of sweet and savoury flavours. Love how the ginger slices can be eaten too!
Hakka Style Golden Fried Chicken ($6.90) wasn't as good as the chicken cutlet, as it was slightly tough. Flavours were still strong!
Definitely coming back for their noodles and sides �",5
"A beautiful creation, this Strawberry St Honore Tart ($10) from @delicatesse.sg was as delicious as it looked!
There were different contrasts in textures, from the smooth richness of the cream, to the crispy yet fluffy shell of the macaron, to the crunchy tart crust. I loved the combination of sweet and sour notes from each layer. The taste of strawberry was light yet not artificial. Love it that it wasn't too sweet overall, especially the macarons!
The tart shell was rather fresh with its crunchy texture and was filled with some kind of rich paste. The strawberry was unfortunately sour, but I guess it goes well with the sweeter layers overall.
A good place to go for some speciality tarts and cakes, albeit being quite expensive!",4
"If you are looking for solid homely food, @keisukegroupsg Gyoza King is one place you have to go. Each Gyoza Set ($14.90) comes with a huge variety of dishes that will please your appetite!
For the Gyoza, both the prawn and pork versions were incredibly juicy. With a slighty crispy exterior, biting into it releases meat juices that were really satisfying � the meat filling within was marinated well and goes well with their ponzu sauce!
You get to have side dishes as well, and both their stir fried and fried options were good. My favourites got to be the stir fried egg with chives and stir fried pork! The egg was perfectly done and I was in love with its fluffy texture. The stir fried pork had a good amount of smoky flavour, which paired well with rice � Soup is also given to wash all of these down.
I definitely would not say that they have the highest quality food, but it gives you a very home-cooked feeling to it. Definitely a comforting meal I will crave from time to time.",5
"Ordered in @engsengfirstgradeseafood for a little dinner treat and I must say, their crabs were delicious and their other dishes were pretty decent!
Eng Seng is known for their black pepper crabs, and I must say they don't disappoint. At $82 per medium crab, they were pretty meaty and definitely very fresh. Love how the meat in the legs comes off easily as a whole! The sauce was glorious, with a sweet savoury profile and deep rich black pepper flavour. The sauce has quite a heat packed in it! Had their chilli crab as well and it was very eggy and shiok �
Other dishes that were great include their Prawn Paste Chicken ($10 for 6) which may have gone soggy due to the packaging, but the rich prawn paste flavour made it addictive! Their Fried Rice ($9 for medium portion) was really good too, with a good amount of wok hei! You can feel the individual grains too �
Definitely a restaurant I will go back to for their crab �",5
"Most will be familiar with @aliceboulangeriesg 's quality desserts, but their range of speciality drinks are very much worth travelling half of Singapore for �
Their Alice Cream Coffee ($7.50) consists of milk, espresso and their speciality whipped cream. I must say, their rendition tastes the closest to the einspanner coffee I've had in South Korea, just that the coffee is slightly milder. The cream has a similar consistency, sweetness and richness! This is one beautiful dessert coffee to sip the afternoon away.
Alice's Iced Orange Espresso ($7.50) is for the people who love something more refreshing. Give it a little mix, and the orange juice adds a sweet tangy citrus flavour to the coffee, which is very much appreciated considering how hot Singapore weather is now! The cream on top just makes it slightly richer, which makes it such a wholesome drink! Squeeze the orange on the cream for added citrus flavour �
As for dessert, we got the Yuzu Apple Tart ($12) which was absolutely splendid. The tart crust itself was the winner for me, as it was so fresh and crisp, with a beautiful buttery flavour. The Yuzu flavours weren't too overpowering and not too sour either. With a great contrast of textures, this is one good dessert to share!
Can't wait to be back to try more of their drinks �",5
"With unlimited free flow sides with every main dish orders, XW Western Grill is one place you can get the bang for your buck, although the quality of sides may not be ideal.
I got the Chicken Chop with Black Pepper Sauce ($14.80) which came with a pretty large slab of chicken, which was well charred and was tender. The sauce reminded me of the kind you get from old school western food stalls. Fries were decent.
As for the sides, most of them were nothing to shout out about, except for the mashed potato which was surprisingly creamy and buttery; quite enjoyable!
I guess this is one place to get your no frills meal settled!",3
"If you work around the area in one north and love your orh nee, @suukeecoffeesg is one place to have a hearty breakfast! With their unique Orh Nee Toast Set ($6.70), my morning was energized �
The toast came slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, and they were filled with a hearty amount of yam paste. It was not too sweet, and although the yam flavour was light, it was rich and aromatic from the coconut milk within. I love how it was really smooth and that no artificial flavours nor colouring was used! This was perfect with their soft boiled eggs, as the sweet and savoury flavours complemented well.
As for the drink, I got the Kopi Siew Dai, which had the right amount of sweetness. The coffee was decent and definitely really strong!
Definitely a breakfast option I will consider around �",5
"@up_____town is a quaint cafe with stylish designs and power plugs around for people to work in, this is one place you can consider to have your work done or a chill time with loved ones!
The Iced Latte ($6.50) came in a large volume, though I really wished they put less milk. The coffee itself was really aromatic with a very smooth nutty flavour and that was really pleasant! Will ask for less milk next time �
The Earl Grey Dirty ($9) was interesting, due to the blend of earl grey tea, coffee, cinnamon and biscoff crumbs. Indeed it was a party of flavours in my mouth, but sadly the coffee was overshadowed by all the other flavours. The Earl Grey definitely comes through strongly, followed by aromatics of the cinnamon and a subtle richness of the coffee. Earl Grey fans, this is for you!
With the cool vibes, I think I would still come back if I'm around the area. The large cup of Iced latte would last me through the work or conversations I'll have!",4
"Haven't been to @tanukiraw in a while, and I am glad to mention that the quality is still really good �
I love it that their lunch sets are also available during the weekends, and I got a Salmon Kaisen Don ($14.90) with a $3 top-up for miso soup, salad and a hot green tea. There was a generous amount of salmon slices of different varieties such as aburi, mentaiko and seasoned mayo. The salmon slices were fresh and fatty, which goes very well with their seasoned rice, which had a good amount of vinegar and sesame seeds. To top it off, the ikura gave the satisfying savoury pop which added more umami flavours to the dish. This is one fulfilling bowl!
If you like heavy flavours, the Hamburguesa Loco ($14) is for you. Imagine 2 thick, juicy, smoky wagyu patties on top of a unique seaweed taco shell, topped with cheese and mayo. This is a flavour bomb, with beef juices and flavour coming through really strongly. One was rich enough for me so this is good to share between 2!
Thank you for inviting @tanukiraw, I definitely will see myself coming back for more!",5
"Tried the insanely popular lala hotpot @ubiclaypotlala! It's decent, but the number of people that day was overwhelming; waited 40 mins to order and another 30 mins for the food and claypot.
The Speciality Broth Big ($22.80) comes with 1kg worth of clams with additional top-ups of clams at $10.80 for every 500g. Free refills for the broth is available. The broth itself is somehow not really flavourful, but it is made much better with 3 ingredients: clams, fried garlic and huatiao wine. Clams were fresh and they provided a delectable sweetness to the broth. Do note that they might contain some mud in them!
You can also add some other ingredients in and my favourites got to be the Australian Beef Slices ($10.80) and Prawn Paste ($10.80). The beef slices were tender and the prawn paste had a bouncy texture with great seafood flavours.
I think it's okay to try if there isn't a queue. This is definitely nowhere as nice as Dai Tao in JB (I'm willing to queue 1hr for that one)!",3
"Ok I'm late to the party, but still glad that I finally tried @eat3bowlssg !! The food items were actually pretty reasonably priced and pretty decent as well.
The Oyster Mee Sua ($8.50) had small plump oysters that were fresh, and I liked how the noodles were not too starchy. You get the rich flavour of the broth, followed by the tangy kick from the vinegar. Decent slurp-worthy bowl!
The Braised Pork Rice ($5.80) was comforting, with tender pieces of pork belly on rice. The pork slices were well braised, as the flavour penetrated throughout the meat and there was no pork foul odour. Portion is pretty reasonable, considering how it is usually served in a small rice bowl.
For sides, we got the Fried Salt & Pepper Chicken ($7.50) which was decent at best. It wasn't very crispy, and we felt like the seasoning didn't penetrate the meat well.
Still a good location for a meal if I'm around the area, but I wouldn't queue too much for this �",4
"Was hyped to try @doqoosg's mochi waffles, but they were sold out at the time of my arrival � nonetheless, I decided to try their create-your-own dessert bowl ($4.30) and found it pretty decent!
As for the base I got the aiyu jelly and the soy bean pudding; the aiyu jelly was surprisingly not really sweet with a faint flavour, and the soy bean pudding was your standard Mr Bean, sweet and smooth.
The osmanthus jelly topping was also just slightly sweet with a subtle aromatic fragrance. Lychee balls were just standard. All bowls come with their taro balls, which were nice and chewy!
Tbh I think most of the sweetness is coming from the sweetened milk! Glad that it's affordably priced, not bad of a dessert to share! Will be back to try their waffles �",4
"An interesting fast food concept, @shiokburger_sg merges the east and west flavours into one, which turns out pretty good!
I got the Beef Cheeseburger Set ($10.99) which comes with a burger, a side and a drink. The beef burger had a thick juicy patty with a slice of melted cheese, all wrapped in a chinese pita bread. Now this is the interesting part, as the pita soaked the juices well, without actually becoming soggy. Unlike normal burger buns, it does not get too doughy! Now this is a worthy invention.
The Ebiko Chicken Burger ($9.99 with set) was also pretty good, with a crispy juicy chicken patty, generously topped with ebiko sauce (seafood umami was faint but still alright). Also quite enjoyable!
Sides had options of beef cheese fries and ebiko tater tots. Both were fresh and crispy, and the beef cheese fries had an interesting touch as the beef on top was flavoured with Chinese spices and cumin. An interesting blend of flavours once again.
Quite decent fast food actually! Maybe the only complaint is the smaller size of burger and sides �",4
"If you love your minced meat noodles and your pork liver, Dong Xue Minipot Noodle got you covered with their quality dishes!
I have eaten their Minipot noodles and their mini steamboat sets before, but their minced meat noodles ($5.50) really won me over completely, especially their pork liver. It was very fresh with little to no pork odour and it was a wonderful al dente texture that is just superior to the grainy kind I am used to. It was also not tough, which means that it was cooked perfectly and not overcooked. Even the sliced pork was very tender.
They do their noodles well too, as their mee pok had an al dente texture, with a good coating of savoury chilli sauce that wasn't too spicy nor too salty. The alkaline taste was quite faint as well!
The soup is decent as well as it was flavoured by the pork liver and probably pork bones.
Honestly, this is probably one of the best minced meat noodles I've had, considering that it ticked the check boxes for all items served. I actually don't mind eating from their stall every week for work lunches!",5
"Back at @fangkocoffee and the food and coffee we had was satisfying �
The Wet Indomie with Chimken ($11) was the upgrade I needed. As an Indomie lover, I liked how the signature taste profile was kept, but upgraded with a sweet savoury and eggy sauce. The smashed chicken was slightly crispy on the edges, not dry and flavoured well with their sambal. I got only level 0 spice and it's already quite spicy for me! The portion is quite huge as well.
The Nasi Lemak Ayam Berempah ($14) features aromatic coconut rice with good fried chicken! The chicken had a crispy exterior with meat within that is not dry. I am happy to note that they seasoned their chicken meat well, as it had flavour all the way to the bone. As expected, their sambal was fiery with a good citrus kick.
To cool off the spice, their Fangko Melaka Brew ($11) is one good option. Creamy, aromatic yet not too sweet, the coffee notes complemented the Gula Melaka very well. This larger bottle is definitely enough for 2 to share!
Thank you @fangkocoffee for the invite! Will be back to try your other coffee variations �",5
"A chocolate speciality store, @chocoelfchocolate definitely ticked many check boxes when it comes to their chocolate desserts. We tried a variety and were impressed!
The Hazelnut Chocolate Tart ($8.50) was our favourite. The hazelnut chocolate within was melty and was very rich and nutty. It was not too sweet and the tart crust was crispy! Hazelnuts were fresh as well!
We ordered 2 Iced chocolate drinks, one classic dark ($7) and another classic dark mint ($8). They were extremely rich and chocolatey, and the taste of the chocolate is really decadent. As much as it was delicious, they got really heavy and I feel like it would be perfect for 2 to share a cup � the dark mint would be perfect for mint lovers as it just shouts MINT�
We got the Chocolate Bark ($6 each) as well, and the pink Ruby Jewel was interesting due to its sour notes.
Come here if you like your chocolate! Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers for inviting!",4
"Had an enjoyable meal at @tipsytavern last night and I must say, I think their food items improved from the last time I went! With a very classy yet intimate atmosphere, this is one place worthy of a good nights out.
The Unagi Don ($24 1-for-1 with #burpplebeyond) was one delicious bowl to savour. The meaty charred unagi was on top of a bed of scrambled eggs that was a delight. The scrambled eggs were very fluffy and seasoned with unagi sauce (I believe) and the sweet and savoury flavours went so well together! The unagi piece was quite sizable and meaty, perfect with the rice below.
The Mentaiko Salmon Don ($28 1-for-1 with #burpplebeyond) was decent, with loads of mentaiko sauce. The mentaiko sauce was very rich, perfect with the crunchy ebiko and ikura eggs. I feel like this bowl can be abit too heavy, maybe better for sharing!
The Strawberry Frozen Magarita is $10 all night, and I think is a great starter to the night. There was some spiced salt at the side of the glass which was a great accompaniment to the sweet drink! Like that it's quite strong as well.
Will be back to try their cocktails next time!",4
"Another gelato shop in the vicinity, @muted.sg offers a variety of gelato flavours that were of quality � We got 2 scoops for $10.
The Earl Grey Sakura was very wonderfully done. The earl grey flavours were strong, very fragrant and yet not too artificial. The Sakura flavour comes in after, making this even more floral tasting! Earl Grey lovers will definitely love this one. Not too sweet either!
The Uji Matcha gelato was very proper, as they even had a cover to prevent oxidation. This was a very unique take on matcha gelato, as it wasn't sweet and the umami flavours were so strong that it tasted almost salty. The quality of matcha used was pretty decadent too! The matcha isn't very strong but definitely still aromatic.
With the beautiful simple interior, this is a place to chill with your friends! Come down and have a try✌️",4
"Back at my favourite Thai food restaurant and the food is still as good as I remembered!
The Claypot Mama with Prawns and Meatball ($13.80) came generous with loads of fresh prawns and meatballs. The soup itself was not too spicy and sweet and savoury. Mixing the egg yolk in makes the soup even richer! The noodles were al dente as well! This is one hearty dish and perhaps the only problem is that the prawns were slightly undercooked.
The Olive Fried Rice ($6.80) had always been consistently good, with the strong umami of the fermented olives coming through and that the rice was fluffy. Drizzle that lime juice all over for a refreshing citrus kick!
The Fried Chicken with Honey Sauce ($8.80) stole the show for us. The chicken pieces were fried to perfection, with the exterior being very crispy and the chicken meat not dry. The honey sauce was splendid, due to its sweet and savoury nature that got us putting it on our rice as well!
This has been our go-to Thai food restaurant for some time and will continue to be �",5
"Tried @bakeopedia.sg and @thebreadracksg new Matcha series and I was SOLD. Even my parents who don't really fancy pastries liked them as well!
The Matcha Raspberry Crossiant came rather huge and they were stuffed with matcha and raspberry cream. Though the matcha flavour is subtle, the tangy citrus raspberry flavour complemented the sweet cream so well! It got me craving for more � the pastry may not be crispy after leaving it overnight, but it was fluffy!
The Matcha Vanilla Cube was also another delight. This time the cream is slightly different, as the matcha taste was stronger and it was more aromatic with the vanilla within! It was also sweeter than the former.
Thank you @bakeopedia.sg for the delicious bakes! Definitely coming back to try out your other creations �",5
"Cosford Container Park opened just a few months ago and they have already gained such a huge fanbase! The container park was so crowded that there were quite a few people waiting for seats by the side. We were there early for dinner and got our favourite classics from the old Timbre+ Eastside.
The Tom Yum Mama Hotpot ($18 for 1 pax) is one of the bestsellers from Streets of Bangkok and we can definitely see why. Al dente mama noodles were in this spicy, tangy yet rich and flavourful broth and they were so darn hearty and addictive! There was quite abit of seafood ingredients which were fresh as well. The 2 egg drops completed the dish, due to its added richness. The only downside is that the area is way too windy and that the fire below isn't too strong, making this less hot than we liked.
The Salmon Mentaiko Don ($12.90) was also one of our favourites. At an affordable price, you get a pretty sizable grilled salmon piece that was fresh and meaty. It was topped with a lot of mentaiko sauce which was so rich with umami! The crispy tempura bits definitely added the contrast in texture that is well appreciated. The runny egg completes the dish �
It may be a journey to come here, but it feels like a getaway from the city. If you are from the east, this is one place you should explore for good food and good vibes!",4
"If you are in the Yishun area, @moinmoingelato is a great place to satisfy your dessert cravings �
We got the Oolong Mandarin with a sea salt brownie, and it was such a good sharing dessert! The Oolong Mandarin scoop was pretty big and it wasn't too sweet. The mandarin and oolong flavours complemented very well together, forming this unique aromatic taste that became pretty addictive.
The Sea Salt Brownie was crispy on the outside and soft within. Definitely very rich, it was really fudgy and I feel like I won't be able to finish this �
There were so many interesting gelato flavours that I wanted to try! Can't wait to be back to try them all!",4
"If you are around the area and crave something comforting, @gochiongseafood got you covered with their fish meat hotpot (starting from $38)! Although it took a while to arrive, it came with a variety of ingredients such as yam, vegetables and both fried fish head pieces and fresh fish slices. The soup is hearty and although it was not as flavourful at the start, it was much better after putting in the fish and green vegetables. Great to share among a larger group!
I believe they can do good zichar dishes, as the Yang Zhou Fried Rice ($6) we got was superb. With a strong wok hei, the rice was also flavourful and had the right bouncy texture. The portion was pretty big with crunchy crystal prawns!
If I am around the area, I would come back for their zichar dishes �
Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers for inviting and @gochiongseafood for the food!",4
"Let this be one of your places to fulfil your hotpot cravings! The buffet here at high tea prices ($20.99 per pax for 2-5pm) was really worth it, considering the quality and variety of dishes you can order!
The soup is separately priced, but is relatively affordable at $13.90 for 3 kinds of soup. Among the 3 we ordered, their signature nourishing soup was our favourite. It was just slightly peppery, but full of herbal, meat and vegetable broth flavour. The combination of flavours was quite unique, different from the broths I've had in other places.
The meats we ordered were all very fresh, but maybe we weren't used to the Mongolian lamb meat, as it was really gamey. Our favourites were the shrimp paste and fish slices, as they were incredibly thick and flavourful!
For desserts, you have to get their man tou, as they were very freshly fried, with a crispy exterior and fluffy inside. They were drenched in condensed milk, the best accompaniment to man tou and great Chinese dessert!
Definitely very value for money especially when it's situated so close in town. Can't wait to be back!",5
"Saw that this patisserie was selling really pretty desserts and wanted to give it a try!
We got 2 desserts and 2 drinks (1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) and the desserts we got were the Blossom and Lychee Rose. The Blossom had a matcha exterior with a Yuzu flavoured centre, and I must say they complemented each other quite well! The citrus yuzu flavour made it not so surfeiting. Love the beautiful crispy shell on top as well!
The Lychee Rose was definitely floral, with the rose notes much heavier than the lychee within. Unfortunately, I feel like there isn't much texture to this dessert, as it was mostly very soft. The biscuit bottom was a bit soggy.
Desserts were good, but maybe only worth with the burpple beyond. An option to consider if you are around the area!",3
"Honestly didn't expect much from this place, but was pleasantly surprised! The food here is definitely of decent quality and pretty affordable prices.
The ������� �������� ���� ($16.80) was one hearty stew. It was rich yet not too spicy and was filled with so many ingredients! Seafood ingredients were admittedly small, but the amount of egg and tofu made up for it as I feel like they were the more important ingredients. The portion is definitely huge!
The ������� ���� ���� ���� ($16.80) was also good. The soup is much sweeter in this one, due to the baked beans used to cook in this one. My favourite got to be the noodles, as they were cooked perfectly al dente. Seafood ingredients were similar to the beancurd soup, with the addition of different sausages! Another hearty soup to enjoy.
Side dishes are free flow and self-serviced. Definitely going back here again!",4
"If you are looking for a quiet cafe to chill at, @clapcafe.sg is a good option � It may be a little tricky to get to as it is hidden from the main road, but the coffee and ambience here makes it worthwhile �
The Iced Latte ($6) was one delicious cup of coffee, as not only it was strong, it wasn't sharp and was very fragrant with its nutty aroma. It had the right amount of ice and milk as well to give an extra richness.
This is one place I will come to hide from the main crowd and just have a good chill time with loved ones!",4
"It was interesting to find out that @cqgf.sg has a buffet menu, and if you are a big eater, this is a very good option to go for! The weekday lunch buffet cost just $28.80, with many grilled fish and side dishes that you can order.
Among all the variations of grilled fish we ordered, the ������� ��� ������ ������� ���� was our favourite. The patin fish used was very meaty and really fresh, and we loved how flaky it was! It was cooked in a very fragrant chilli oil that isn't too spicy and yet very flavourful!
Among the many selections of side dishes that we enjoyed such as saliva chicken, seasoned black fungus as well as egg fried rice, the ����� ��� ��� ���� ��������� ���� was the perfect accompaniment to the grilled fish. It was crispy, fluffy and the sweet touch of the condensed milk gave a good break to the savoury meal we were having.
Can't wait to be back to have a feast with my friends here again!",5
"If you like some interesting coffee creations, @tomocafesg is one good place to go for. With a huge selection of both espresso and non-espresso drinks, we settled on an Iced Kuro Goma Coffee ($8) and an Iced Honeycomb Latte ($7).
The Iced Kuro Goma Coffee came in a beautiful form, with thick luxurious looking Goma cream on top of the latte. The cream itself was savoury and had aromatic rich flavours of black sesame. I loved how the savoury and nutty flavour of the cream complemented the bold aromatic flavour of the coffee so well! This is one coffee worth sipping for.
The Iced Honeycomb Latte was also delicious, as the subtle caramelised notes of the dalgona gave the coffee further depth! Do remember to take out some towards the middle of your drinking experience as it can get quite sweet towards the end �
Definitely coming back to try more coffee variations!",5
"Probably one of the most famous chicken rice shop in Singapore, Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice in Katong Shopping Centre gathers a huge crowd who are willing to queue to have our national dish. We decided to brave the queue and got our spread in about 30 mins.
We got the mixture chicken set for 4 ($26) which came in a huge plate. Both roasted chicken and steamed chicken were doused in a sweet savoury sauce and topped with loads of fried garlic. I must say that their quality of chicken still remained rather high, as the chicken was moist, flavourful and most importantly fresh. The skin of the roasted chicken was the best, as there was the added caramelised flavour of rendered fat.
The chicken rice came with 2 different kind of soups: a black herbal one and a standard cabbage soup. The black herbal one contains a chicken feet, and the herbal flavour was quite mild. The cabbage soup was flavourful but abit too peppery for my liking. The achar that came with the set was delightful due to the large chunks of seasoned pineapple that were good appetizers!
Actually for the portion of meat given, it's actually quite worth it. The only complaint should be the rice itself, as it wasn't as flavourful as we wanted it to be. Oh and their chilli deserves a shout out too, as it was not too spicy, but had the perfect amount of vinegar and garlic to pair with the savoury chicken �",5
"Bedok residents will rejoice, as the famous L32 handmade noodles will be relocating there and they will get to have such quality comfort food much more conveniently!
I have eaten their handmade noodles countless times throughout the years and their quality is still as good. The Dumpling Handmade Noodle ($6.50) came with generous amounts of their handmade noodle which was really chewy and al dente. You don't get much of the dough taste either, which is just telling of how well executed the cook is. The noodles were well coated with their secret sweet savoury sauce, which was a delight to enjoy. The dumplings were delicious as well, as it was meaty and came with a pretty large piece of prawn! To enjoy the noodles even better, you can take the egg yolk out of the soup on the side and drench it all over the noodles for a richer taste �
Hands down this remains as one of the best handmade noodles I've had.",5
"Finally checked @kafeutu off my bucket list! African style food isn't common in Singapore and it was definitely an interesting gastronomical experience! We decided to play abit safer and here are the items we got:
Smoked Pork Belly ($18) - very delectable, the pork belly was rather tender and very rich and smoky. Flavour profile is close to bacon! It is a bit too rich for 1 to finish; would make a good sharing dish.
Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($20) - this was well executed, with the light crispy batter and succulent meat within. The interesting part is their chilli sauce. It has a good kick, with a hint of spices that I have not tasted before!
Calamari Essaouira ($31) - a good hearty stew, it has a good savoury tangy tomato base, with a hint of spice. The calamari was very fresh, due to its crisp texture. This was a comforting dish to have with rice.
Mocha ($7) - good dark chocolate was used and I could still taste the strong coffee notes. It was a good blend and I wished I got a latte instead so that I could taste the coffee more!
Dishes and drinks were all well executed, but it wasn't anything really mind blowing. Considering the price, I don't think I will come back again anytime soon actually. Still, it's an interesting place to try once!",4
"A recommendation from a friend that I very much needed. This Bun Cha ($9.50) from Little Hanoi is very much a hidden gem that more people should go for!
Hidden within the huge Food Republic food court near Shaw, their Bun Cha came pretty generous with loads of different meats. Their meats were all incredibly smoky, especially the pork belly. I must say that they were abit too dry, but the flavours really made up for it. The meatball given was decent, but the spring rolls were absolutely lovely. They were very crispy on the outside and so meaty within. All the rich meats were well complemented with the cabbage and rice noodles underneath!
I was so glad that they did not neglect their soup as well; it was flavourful yet comforting.
Really one of the best Bun Cha I've had so far. Definitely a cheap food option around town that I will consider!",4
"If you are looking for a good place to chill and relax, @theofficialtce_sg at Star Vista is one place to go to. The chill ambience coupled with decent coffee and a view of cute cats playing around right beside was exactly what I needed!
I had an Iced Latte ($6.50) and although it may look quite watery here, I'm glad that the coffee flavour was pretty aromatic and flavourful still. It was quite smooth and had a rounded flavour profile. Not bad of a cup!",4
"Finally tried @monkitaiwansg at Star Vista and food was pretty decent!
I was actually quite impressed with the Shredded Chicken Mee Sua ($7.80), as the noodles still had abit of bite to them, giving a small contrast in texture. The soup itself was quite flavourful without being too salty. Too bad they ran out of oysters!
Fried Salt and Pepper Chicken ($6) was my choice side. They were fried to perfection, as the exterior was very light and crispy, with the meat staying succulent. However, it can be quite salty towards the end!
The Cheese Sausage Egg Roll ($8) was very interesting, as the exterior was grilled till crispy. I honestly couldn't taste the cheese, as it was drenched heavily in mayo and sauces � Kinda expensive for the ingredients used!
A possible option if you are in the area!",4
"Was around the area and chanced upon @fangkocoffee to grab a quick coffee fix! I'm glad to mention that the Iced Latte ($5.50) that we got was actually quite a big cup, definitely making the price really worth it for speciality coffee! The coffee was definitely of a strong dark roast, with a slight acidity. It was quite fragrant as well with the nutty notes, making this quite an enjoyable cup. With a chill ambience, this would make a good place to work or to have a good conversation with your friends if you are around the area! They have some interesting coffee variations that I will check out in future �",4
"Celebrate CNY with your family with @tanameracoffeesg 'sTraditional Lou Hei Set ($45.80)! It was a scrumptious and generous one, as it was made in house. I love how they were very generous with the smoked salmon pieces; definitely enough for everyone �
If you do pop by the Robertson Quay outlet, do try their Squid Ink Rice ($20.80) as well! I absolutely loved every part of the dish as they were all well executed. The fried rice itself had a strong wok hei, with a strong savoury seafood flavour. The spice level was also just nice. The beef ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and they were so well marinated. The sambal was very aromatic, perfect with the crackers!
For the sweet tooth, the Coconut Milk Pancake ($15.80) is good for sharing and the pancake is soft with a rich aromatic coconut fragrance. However, I do wish that the pancake was less dense and fluffier. If not, it is a good dessert!
Thank you @burpple for inviting and @tanameracoffeesg for the food! We enjoyed ourselves very much �",4
"Had such a good time at @arizesg and we loved their food, drinks and live band performance! Here are some of our favourites:
Grilled Chicken Chop with Brown Demi Sauce ($12.80) - the chicken chop itself was pretty huge and I loved how there was a slight smokiness and the skin was crispy while the meat remained succulent. The sauce was very memorable, due to its rich savoury flavour. Fries were addictive too!
Arize's Applewood Smoked NZ Ribeye ($26.80) - the smokiness is much more prominent in this one and the meat was moderately tender and definitely flavourful. Mash and corn were done decently well too.
Meal aside, you can't leave this place without trying their drinks as well as their small bites with the live band performance! The performance starts at 8pm on Tues, Fri and Sat. Here are some beer and bar bites we have had:
Geisshugel Lager/Ale ($12.80/pint) - I'm surprised that their beer is from the microbrewery at Level 33 and it was splendid. The lager was rather light and very smooth and crisp. The ale was even better, as it isn't overly hoppy and was actually very smooth towards the end without giving the huge bitter aftertaste.
Cheesy Fries ($7.80) - this came in a generous portion and was devoured within minutes. Generous splatter of cheese and crispy yet fluffy fries... What's there to not like! In fact we were all very happy with their generous portions of bar food and prices!
Definitely coming back here to have a good time with the food, beers and live band performance. This place definitely has the good vibes for a relaxing night with loved ones! Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting and @arizesg for the amazing spread!",5
"It was our first time trying out Burmese cuisine and we definitely found them to be really interesting! I tried flavours that I have not experienced before �
Pickled Tea Leaves Rice with Fried Chicken ($10.90) - this was really unique, as you can taste the fermented flavour of the tea leaves immediately. There were alot of fried garlic flakes within, which made this really flavourful. Definitely quite spicy as well. The fried chicken was very well executed, due to its extremely crispy skin and pretty juicy meat!
Mohinga ($9.90) - this noodle soup tasted abit like assam laksa. Flavours were not too strong but it was alot of hard or crunchy bits. Alot of textures going on, not like a smooth clear soup.
Caramelised Pork ($11) - this was the crowd favourite. They say fat is flavour, and this seems to be representing that point well � the pork meat was swimming in its own fat, and it was really rich and rather tender. Flavour is quite close to that of braised meat. Not too foreign and definitely tasty!
Roselle Leaves ($8) - this is one funky tasting vegetable. The texture is similar to bamboo shoot, but the initial flavour is definitely not for everyone. It was very spicy though! I don't hate it, but I wouldn't order it again �",4
"Right smack in the heart of the busy haji lane lies @coffeedonkee which offers mainly Japanese style filtered coffee and other variations.
As we prefer our coffee with milk, we ordered the Iced Latte ($7.50) and Iced Mocha ($8). The Iced Latte was indeed as creamy as it looked, but unfortunately the coffee flavour was not as strong as we liked and perhaps a little too milky. It was also rather difficult to taste the coffee notes within the Iced Mocha, but at least the chocolate used was rich and aromatic.
Though the place boasts a chill atmosphere, we do prefer a stronger coffee. Perhaps we ordered the wrong variations �",3
"@omote.sg comes to many people's minds when they crave for good Japanese food, and similarly I went there to satisfy my sashimi cravings and left really satisfied �
The Upsized Chirashi ($22.80) had a heaping about of seasoned sashimi pieces and you get a good variety of salmon, tuna, swordfish, octopus and so on. The pieces were rather chunky and fresh and I adored how fatty the salmon pieces were. Interestingly, I felt like there was too much sashimi than I could handle; perhaps I should have gone for the normal sized bowl instead �
Do add on their lunch set ($8.80) as it really completes the meal with more thick salmon sashimi pieces, appetisers, soup and dessert! They were pretty generous with their amounts and we left extremely stuffed.
Definitely a good treat for the fellow sashimi lovers!",5
"We had a good time at @supplydemandnovena , trying out several dishes including items from their exclusive passholder menu (marked by �) and their weekend small bites brunch menu (marked by ☀️). Here are our favourites:
Spicy Bokkeum Stir-fry � ($8.90) - this is one dish I don't mind getting regularly for work lunches. The stir fry was moderately spicy and comforting, and the pork collar meat was tender and drenched in this satisfying kimchi sauce. The rice was topped with a perfect sunny side up too! Definitely a filling meal.
Pumpkin Pesto � ($16.90) - I love thin crust pizzas and this was decent too. The crust was soft and fluffy and was topped generously with ingredients. Although the pesto flavour was subtle, the large amount of savoury cheese made up for it. The pizza was quite huge and would make a good sharing dish!
Cheeseburger Inspired Fries ($17) - now this is the ultimate sharing dish for groups. The thick cut fries were addictive due to its satisfyingly crispy exterior and soft fluffy centre, and they were blanketed with a thick layer of cheese for extra richness and beef balls for the extra meatiness.
Mexican Punch ☀️ ($7.90) - to wash all of the greasiness down, the Mexican Punch did the trick. At an unbeatable price, the cocktail came in a big cup and was very refreshing for the afternoon heat. I could taste the alcohol too! A lovely tropical drink for everyone to enjoy.
As the cafe was located on a rather quiet side of Novena, this cafe is good to escape from the traffic noise and chill with friends and loved ones. Thank you @supplydemandnovena for the food and @marque.sg for inviting!",4
"Been wanting to find a good ramen place and I'm glad that Ramen Kiou hit the spot. We had their tonkutsu ramen and their gyoza and we were all very impressed!
The Deluxe Shoyu Tonkutsu Ramen ($15.20) was such a delight to enjoy. The soup itself was very rich and fatty, with complementary umami flavours coming from the pork bone broth and shoyu. All these were achieved without being too salty! The noodles were rather springy and the char siew was glorious. It was very tender, fatty and meaty all at the same time. I cleaned up the bowl without a single drop of soup left!
The Gyoza ($6.20) was decent, but the Mentai Mayo Gyoza I added ($3.70 with a drink) was even better. The mentaiko sauce has a lot of roe and was beautifully rich, complementing well with succulent gyoza meat.
A very comforting and delicious meal that I can't wait to have again!",5
"We were finding desserts around the area, and chanced upon Chowzan desserts, which serves up traditional Chinese desserts in a homely shop. We craving some durians desserts and got their Fried Durian Ball ($13.90) and Double D24 Boost (12.90).
The Durian Balls had a crispy exterior and gooey centre filled with durian cream. Unfortunately, the durian cream was not as fragrant as expected. Perhaps it is because it is not the durian season, hence it does not have the powerful oomph factor I was looking for.
The Double D24 Boost's durian flavour was also lackluster, but the coconut cream was very rich! It was a good accompaniment to the durian cream.
Perhaps we shouldn't have ordered the durian desserts when it's not the season � I saw many people eating their white Chendol instead and perhaps I will try that next time!",3
"Been to this restaurant multiple times over the years and we loved how they managed to maintain their food and service quality all these while. We had their Baked Sea Perch ($28) and Honey Charred Chicken ($22) and both were absolutely splendid.
The Baked Sea Perch was meaty and very fresh, with a good natural sweetness. I loved the perfectly grilled skin, as it was so crispy and very well seasoned. This is really hard to do without overcooking the meat underneath! The mashed potatoes underneath were creamy and well seasoned as well, and the asparagus was just lovely with the crispy leafy parts.
The Honey Charred Chicken was not too sweet, and yet you get the really nice honey taste together with the savoury flavour of the chicken. It was grilled perfectly as well, with the perfect amount of smokiness. The fries were absolutely moreish, due to its crispy exterior and sweet creamy flavour within.
For drinks we got the Sparkling Berry Apple ($10) and Lychee Rose Frizz ($10) which were both delightfully refreshing.
We really had no complaints at all for the food and service given. With 1 for 1 mains and drink using #burpplebeyond, we can't help but to think when is the next time we will be back again!",5
"@newdelibakes is a popular pastry store known for their quality bakes, and I gotta say their coffee is pretty good as well!
We got the Iced Latte ($6) which had a beautiful dark brown colour and it tasted as good as it looked. It has a nice nutty fragrance and was not acidic at all. A very smooth cup, even the aftertaste was not too bitter. A great cup to pair their bakes!
Iced Mocha ($6) may not be part of the menu, but the owners were very kind to make one for us. It was very smooth as well, not grainy and complemented the aromatic coffee well. You can still taste the coffee too!
Great to know that there is great coffee and pastries near my house �",4
"Ever tried Eastern European cuisine before? @kapitan.sg is a great place to start, with its chill ambience and great food �
My favourite out of all got to be the Salo ($14.90), which was some kind of cold pork belly which was super addictive. The slices were very tender and succulent, and I loved the savoury cured flavour. Pair them with mustard and their sourdough, and you got yourself a fancy appetiser!
Their Dumpling Combo Platter ($17.90) was also a great sharing dish. I love how the dumpling skin was bouncy with a great mouthfeel. The meat within was pretty succulent as well. Loved the beef one with mayo!
The Zharkoe ($27.90) came in a big bread bowl, and it was filled with cheese, potato and a very hearty pork stew. This is one good dish to share and can be very filling.
If you need a drink, the Triple Vodka Martini ($25) is one option. This was quite strong and the Lemon flavour didn't taste too artificial!
It was a great meal at Kapitan � Thank you @kapitan.sg for the food and @smolbelly for inviting!",4
"Chanced upon this quiet little cafe @onnecafe.sg and immediately it reminded me of the cute cafes I used to go to in Korea. I was sold to the vibes and definitely the food!
We had their Momo Sencha Gelato ($4.50) with their Matcha Mochi Waffle ($9) and we liked it! The generous scoop of gelato itself was milky, not too sweet, and I like how the peach flavour isn't artificial and slightly subtle. The sencha tea flavour then comes after, making this really refreshing. The mochi waffle was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Though we wished the mochi was chewier, it tasted good and I could taste the slight earthy notes of the matcha flavour too.
Now this is one cafe I will be back. Great for studying and having good quiet conversations too!",4
"This place needs no introduction, as they are so famous for their oriental desserts! Most people go for their Chendol dessert, but I think standards for their Chendol might have decreased. However, I am happy to report that their other oriental desserts fare way better!
Their Orh Ni ($5.80) may come in a small bowl, but it was a quality bowl. The yam used was very rich and aromatic, and I love how you taste the natural yam flavour more without it being too sweet. The coconut milk on top made the dessert even richer, while the fresh ginko nut added texture.
The Fresh Mango Sago with Ice Cream ($6.50) was terrific as well, as it wasn't overly sweet or surfeiting! The mango flavour is strong, and I especially loved the touch of the ice cream as it wasn't too sweet and it added extra milky flavour to the dish. This may be one of the best I've had actually.
Lastly, the Chendol ($3.80) was unfortunately disappointing as the Gula Melaka was somehow not rich, and I don't get much coconut flavours as well. Somehow, this was much more bland than I remembered.
Nonetheless, I will still come back for their other dessert options!",4
"A popular choice for no frills meals among the crowd in Bugis, @qqnoodlehousesg serves up rather affordable noodle dishes that were pretty decent! I had the Signature Kolo Mee ($7.50 with extra noodles) with a basic sauce and it was not bad. The noodles were al dente and springy, and although they may look plain, they were very flavourful with pork lard and garlic. I really thoroughly enjoyed the noodles, but unfortunately the ingredients were nothing much to shout about. The char siew was tough and not so flavourful sadly �. I can see why it's popular for affordable meals, and I can see myself coming if I just want a simple meal.
Not too bad if you're around the area, but maybe not worth it to come down just for this �",4
"Finally had a chance to dine at @limesingapore for their weekend lunch buffet ($78++) and it's definitely pretty decent with just some misses!
The highlight got to be their seafood selection, with several exquisite items such as freshly shucked oysters, Boston lobsters and snow crab legs. The oysters were fantastic; juicy, succulent with fresh seafood savouriness. The crab legs were meaty, fresh and naturally salty.
For many buffets, they don't do their roast beef right. However, the rendition at Lime hits differently as it was surprisingly tender with a good beefy flavour. One of my favourites was actually their Cheese Wheel Pasta, it was so creamy, rich, cheesy and the pasta was al dente. Actually went to take 3 portions in total!
Cakes were mostly good, as they were rich and moist.
And as all buffets, they have their misses. The sashimi here was really not good, especially their tuna. The other Japanese items like sushi were really forgettable. Ice cream selections were just too frozen hard to grab anything.
Nonetheless, this is still a decent buffet to go for your celebrations. With a beautiful ambience, I believe it is date night worthy!",4
"If you are not sure what to get at Redhill Hawker Centre, the Beef Hor Fun ($6) from Wok Hei Hor Fun is a great option!
Their hor fun noodles are silky smooth and they stayed true to their name as the noodles had a good smoky flavour. The sauce they used was really garlicky and flavourful. The beef slices were also pretty tender! The best part is the fresh crispy pork lard, which adds a whole dimension of umami flavour and texture to the dish.
This is a well rounded dish that got me slurping up the whole plate! I love how comforting this is and I will definitely come back for this again �",5
"If you are around the area, this is one zi char place you can consider!
Wok Master offers a huge variety of food items in the menu and we selected a few. For the finger food items, the Handmade Prawn Roll ($12) and Pork Belly with Red Beancurd ($12) were great. The prawn rolls were crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, perfect with their homemade sambal! The fried pork belly was also well fried, with a strong umami taste.
The Lala Bee Hoon ($14) takes the cake for me, with its adequately strong wok hei, flavourful soup and fresh clams! This is one dish I don't mind having all by myself �
Unfortunately, the Wok Master Premium Claypot ($32) was a miss for me. The broth was a little strange and it was mostly vegetables. Felt like it was way too expensive for what was offered.
All in all, I felt like the food was decent but can be quite expensive. Also, during this upcoming CNY festive period, if you are thinking of getting some CNY set meals for takeaway, they do takeaway CNY sets, as well as Yu Sheng with Baby Abalone going at $48.80. Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers @wokmastersg for the invite!",4
"Back at @onkei.tonkatsu to try their other tonkatsu variations and was satisfied with their Cheese Rosu-Katsu Set ($19.90)!
The pork fillet was quite well fried till golden brown and it was stuffed full of cheese! The meat itself may be a little dry, but it is definitely meaty. The chicken is best paired with the tonkatsu sauce, which was pretty tangy to cut the rich fat flavour from the cheese and meat fillet. They offer free refills of rice, soup and cabbage, and I liked the soup the best due to its rich meaty and umami flavours.
This may not be one of the best tonkatsu I've eaten, but it's definitely decent, filling and affordable. A great lunch option for the offices nearby!",4
"Yet another bad experience � We went to Thirteen BBQ Bar in search of good Chinese BBQ but they just fell short of expectations...
Firstly, there was alot of confusion. Confusion in making the order between us and the waiter, and confusion in the kitchen in executing those orders. Food went to the wrong tables and some items didn't come. I tried to tell them our rice didn't come but they ended up double charging for the rice when the bill came �
Secondly, food was just churning out too slowly. The food items came out with too long intervals and we were mostly waiting. We ended up frustrated and told the waiter to pack the rest of the unfinished orders to go. Saw another table that did the same too...
Thirdly, the food was mostly mediocre. The skewers were really small and tough. Only the fried noodles ($8) was worth a mention. The noodles had a good texture, it was flavourful and well stir-fried due to the slight smoky aroma in the noodles.
The staff were indeed apologetic, but I think there is really a need to relook at their processes. They have the potential to be better!",2
"Once again back at our favourite gelato shop and left fully satisfied!
We had their Lava Cake ($6.50), but although it wasn't as flowy as the previous time we had, it was still as rich and chocolatey as I remembered! Perfect accompaniment to our gelato! The flavours we had were their Tiramisu ($6.50) and Summer Fruit ($5) which were top-notch.
The Tiramisu gelato had a good balance of coffee and chocolate flavours, with a tinge of alcohol. It was rich and aromatic, all without being too sweet. The biscoff crumbs added extra texture! The Summer Fruit was a direct contrast, with its sour tangy and citrusy flavours. It tasted very strongly of passionfruit which made it absolutely refreshing for the hot weather.
We love how the owners were so kind and generous in giving out their free samples of ice cream before your order, and I think this is what makes their customers come back too. Will be back again and again!",5
"Finally tried this popular eatery selling fresh clams dishes, but sadly we didn't like them too much.
The Power Drunken Lala Soup ($8.90) sadly did not live up to our expectations. The Chinese wine taste wasn't strong enough and though the broth had the sweetness from the clams, we found it rather one dimensional. The clams were fresh but rather small.
The Vongole ($10.90) may be garlicky, but it was really cloying and the cream taste wasn't of a quality one.
Luckily, the dishes were not too expensive and had rather large portions. I guess this is just a one time try for us �",2
"Never thought I would get good food from a themed cafe, but @actioncitycafe proved otherwise!
The Flamed Kissed Grilled Steak ($24) was all in all pretty spectacular. Although the beef steak turned out cooked beyond the requested medium rare, it was surprisingly very tender and juicy. The knife cut through it really pretty easily! The herb butter on top made it even better by providing additional richness and garlic umami. However, I do hope that there was more of the beef flavour. Nonetheless, it was a pretty amazing steak!
The Healthy Toasted Medley ($24) was equivalent to your full English breakfast but healthier, and it was pretty good too! The sourdough was well buttered and toasted without being too hard and the eggs were quite well cooked.
Coffee here was also pretty decent! The Iced Latte ($6) was pretty fragrant and not acidic at all. The Iced Mocha ($7) was not too sweet and I could tell that quality chocolate was used.
Definitely will be back �",4
"If you never had Jiro Style Ramen before, I can tell you that this is not for everyone. I would describe it as tonkotsu on steroids; everything is rougher, chunkier and richer. If you love a hardcore intense flavour, then you will definitely love this.
The Megamen ($13.90) at @brosramen is the Jiro Style ramen and I must say, it taste almost exactly like what I had in Japan. The soup itself is extremely thick, rich and creamy and would definitely be too salty for most people, but to me it just shouts flavour. You can really taste the soya sauce and the pork broth here. The noodles are much thicker than usual, hence it has a good bite to it which I loved. You might notice that the ramen toppings are quite unusual, but that is how it is supposed to be! It is topped with a generous amount of bean sprouts to cut the fat flavour, and a huge amount of garlic and pork fat to intensify the flavour more. The cha shu may be a chunky piece, but it was so tender and marinated well.
That said, if you prefer a lighter tasting ramen, then this is really not for you!
I believe most of their ramen are saltier than your usual ramen chains to suit the Japanese palette, and that is why I saw so many Japanese people having a regular meal there. Definitely an authentic experience, as I felt like I was transported back to Japan. Absolutely splendid and I can't wait to try their other bowls.",5
"If you are around in Buona Vista or One-north, this is one Korean restaurant you can consider!
The Seafood Pancake ($18) is the must get here to share. Among all the dishes we ordered, this was really the winner! We loved how the pancake was thin, not doughy and full of ingredients. There was a beautiful crispy crust throughout the whole pancake, which gave both flavour and texture to it. The seafood within is pretty fresh and definitely paired well with the sauce given.
The Beef Bulgogi ($17) was pretty decent, as the meat was pretty tender. This can be quite sweet, so for savoury lovers this might not be for you.
The Soybean Soup ($15) is darker than usual, probably because of the use of a dark soybean paste. The soup was also decent, as it was comforting and had full of ingredients. However, I find it a bit too sweet once again.
6 side dishes were given and they were not bad, nothing much to shout out about. Definitely a restaurant I can consider when I'm in the area!",4
"[PROMO CODE BELOW] Had a huge feast at @8degreesatsg and we were all so satisfied by the food and drinks!
I actually don't usually enjoy the Taiwan style Mee Sua, but the Chitterling and Oyster Mee Sua ($7) at 8 degrees really changed my opinion. It was flavourful and really hearty, and I like how the intestines were fresh and the oysters were plump and juicy! Noodles were not too soft as well.
As for the sides, all of them were really good and addictive. If I were to choose favourites, it would be the Fried Shiitake Mushroom ($8.90) and the Salted Chicken ($7). The Fried Shiitake Mushroom was perfectly fried till golden brown, with a very juicy mushroom within. Pair them with their homemade mayo and you got yourself an addictive side! The Salted Chicken was a winner, with light crispy batter and juicy meat within. We loved the savoury flavour and kept going for more.
As for their drinks, their Milk Tea with Pearl ($5.90 for large) really took the cake. Strong aromatic tea flavour with quality milk, it was a refreshing drink. The only problem we had was that we wished the pearls were cooked longer, so that they can be more chewy and softer.
For everyone who are reading this, there is a promo code for you! Key in ""8DU15"" in the online order chit when you scan their order QR code to get 15% off your total bill! Please feel free to use the code on any of their outlets. Please note that their Serangoon outlet has relocated to Kovan.
Absolutely fantastic meal and I can't wait to be back. Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers for inviting and @8degreesatsg for the food!",5
"Yet another cafe has joined the playing field in offering nian gao waffles!
Situated next to the popular Lickers cafe, Creme by Lele Bakery offers a good range of gelato flavours to go with their nian gao waffles. We got the Matcha and Chrysanthemum Cacao Nib flavours and we were pretty satisfied with them!
The Matcha flavour can be said to be a safe choice, as the matcha flavour is quite strong without being too sweet. The Chrysanthemum Cacao Nib was my favourite, due to its rich and aromatic chrysanthemum flavour, while the chocolate flavour from the cacao nibs gave a good contrast in flavour and texture.
The nian gao waffles were of the doughy kind which I love. Soft and buttery, there were some nian gao within the waffles which gave additional chewy texture and sweetness �
Definitely an ice cream cafe I would consider!",4
"I love a good bowl of noodles and the Hakka Noodles from Fifty Year Yong Tau Foo is a good one I need to share!
At $5.50, the biggest portion possible, the bowl came with a substantial amount of noodles with quite a few Yong tau foo ingredients like meatballs and bean curd skin. The noodles itself were springy, and heavily seasoned by their signature chilli sauce which had alot of umami coming from the dried shrimp used. It is topped with small pieces of pork lard which added extra richness and texture!
The yong tau foo ingredients were rather decent and my favourite got to be their meatballs which were quite huge and meaty. I love how they did not neglect their soup, as it was a rich broth and comforting, all without being too salty.
This is one place you gotta eat while you're here at Holland Drive Food Centre!",5
"Due to the recent rainy weather, I realised that I crave for fish soups more than usual, and Song's Fish Soup came into my mind!
Their rendition ($5.50 a bowl) is definitely a quality one, due to its rich milky soup flavoured by a base fish broth, milk, shallots and most importantly, a fried egg. They accomplished a good enough depth of flavour, all without being too salty. The fish slices were all very fresh and thick, even for their fried ones. They were perfect with their chilli sauce, which they mixed some fermented bean sauce that gave it extra umami. An enjoyable bowl I will have whether I'm around the area.
Among the few fish soup stalls in the hawker centre, I believe this is the best.",5
"If you love your cheeseburgers, you really don't want to miss this place! @yeoldecow serves up delicious cheeseburgers, addictive fries and absolutely refreshing beers at their food truck.
I had the Traditional Cheeseburger ($18.40) which had 2 dry aged beef patties, 2 slices of cheese, pickles, onions and their house mayo. Now this is one glorious burger, because they really nailed the patties. The patties were juicy, perfectly cooked till medium, and because they were smashed, the sides had a good crust. There was quite alot of meat in each bite and I love how the meat to bun ratio was perfect as well. Buns were soft and nicely buttered. I asked for my onions to be caramelised, giving this burger a slightly sweet touch. The cheese just brought everything together and made the flavour richer. Reviewing this burger got me salivating again!
The addition of fries ($4) was definitely a good decision, as it came in generous portions worthy to share! They were skinny cut, and the outside was crispy while the inside remained fluffy. Now these are really addictive quality fries!
Can't wait to sink my teeth into their burgers again �",5
"Now this is one dessert I wish I knew earlier �
Situated conveniently on level 1 of 100AM mall, @beansfactory.singapore offers a variety of soy based desserts. We had the Yam Yam on the Soya Ice ($9.80) which came with generous portions of yam paste and shaved soya ice. All ingredients served were not so sweet, and the yam paste was so smooth and rich, perfect with the light soya ice! The soya balls were chewy, but the yam balls had an even better chewy texture, coupled with a good yam flavour. Pair everything with abit of the aromatic black sugar syrup, and you got yourself a perfect yam dessert.
Yam fans, this is one dessert you should not miss!",5
"Tried @goyohansoul and the Korean food is decent.
We had the Spicy Pork BBQ ($16 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) and the pork was tender, quite decently flavoured and had a rather generous portion. It wasn't too spicy and it was a great pairing with rice! We just wished that it could be served warmer.
The Hot Pot Beef Soup ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) came in an enormous bowl with quite generous portions of beef and glass noodles! The soup is definitely comforting and has a sweet salty profile which we liked. Beef slices were fresh but can be a little tough.
The Fried Dumplings ($12) were small and rather expensive, but they were well fried due to its crispy edges. They had quite some fillings as well.
Side dishes were okay, nothing much to show out about. Nonetheless, the food is decent and a lunch option to consider if you are around the area! Quite worth it with burpple beyond!",4
"Finally tried this extremely famous porridge stall, with queues reaching up to an hour. Equipped with number systems and people willing to sit outside in the heat for an hour, they got to be doing something right.
I had the Pork Organ Porridge ($6) and indeed it was quality porridge. It was flavourful and filled with loads of ingredients such as pork liver, pork intestines and cuttlefish. The liver was fresh and not overcooked, and the intestines were surprisingly not smelly at all. Pork balls and slices of lean meat were tender! Add in a dough fritter ($1.20), and you got yourself a complete porridge experience!
It was definitely a good porridge, but I feel like I wouldn't queue for more than 15 minutes for this. I think a 1 hour wait is really quite far-fetched for a porridge �",4
"A known gem in Hougang, I had to find out how good the Mee Jiang Kueh is at Block 682 Hougang Ave 8. As what other reviews had mentioned, this is one solid MHK that I will definitely crave!
They are known for their enclosed pancakes, and you will realise that they are much bigger than those offered in other places. Stuffed full of ingredients, their pancake was truly a delight to enjoy. The Yam version ($1.70) was spectacular, with a smooth sweet yam paste within that isn't too surfeiting. The Peanut version ($1.50) was stuffed full of grounded peanuts and sugar as well that tasted so fresh. Even the pancake skin itself was good, as it was soft, doughy and slightly sweet.
It was so good that I went back to the shop a total of 3 consecutive times! Definitely a must get when you're here in Hougang �",5
"If you like your coffee, I highly recommend that you head over to Waved Coffee to have a little experience with science and coffee. Interestingly, they use electromagnetic waves to treat their coffee, which surprisingly produces a different flavour!
To have a full experience, you can get their coffee flight ($6.50), which is available both black and white. They will give you 2 small cups, 1 before the treatment and 1 after. You can choose from their selection of local blends, but we decided to go for their house blend. Their house blend is definitely a strong, aromatic one, and one significant difference I find from the EM wave treatment is that it does significantly make the bitterness of the coffee mellower, without removing their flavour notes.
Their Iced Mocha ($7.50) was splendid as well, as it was very smooth, rich and yet not surfeiting. Getting the homeground coffee blend was great for the mocha, due to its strong chocolate notes.
We tried some of their juices as well, and we loved them too! They were incredibly smooth and had a great blend of fruity flavours.
Definitely worth a visit, especially when the drinks are available 1 for 1 on #burpplebeyond !",5
"@tomspalettesg is familiar to many throughout the years, due to their huge variety of flavours and quality gelato! Do expect to find flavours that are interesting as well, such as Nasi Lemak and pipagao! However, my favourites are still their alcoholic flavours, as they remained pretty strong throughout the years!
The Guinness Chocolate was a good blend of flavours, with the aromatics of the chocolate complementing well with the rich roasty flavour of the stout. This was not too sweet as well.
The Rum & Raisin is a classic favourite, with a strong rum flavour. The vanilla milk base was rich and fragrant to begin with, making this such a hit! However, it can be a bit sweet so maybe a contrasting flavour might help.
One of my favourite dessert places to go!",4
"I was very surprised by the rendition of fish and chips from @fryingfishclub , as it is definitely one of the meatiest fish and chips I've had so far!
The Signature Fish and Chips ($18.50) came with 2 thick strips of fish fillet, and they were beautifully fried till crispy golden brown. Though slightly thicker than usual, the batter was still light and crispy on the edges. The fish within was very meaty and flaky, with a natural fresh sweet flavour. Fries were splendid; crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and seasoned well with salt and spices. The edamame was a good pairing! Definitely refreshing from the other fried ingredients.
The Nori Fish and Chips ($19.50) was an interesting twist, with a somewhat thick batter seasoned with Nori and other spices. The seaweed taste is strong and actually complements the fish well, but I would have loved it more if the batter was not so thick!
With a cozy bar like ambience, this is not bad of a place to consider to have a fun night with friends over drinks! Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers from inviting and @fryingfishclub for the food!",4
"I have been to @theshelterroot before for their quality coffee, and I'm glad that I've tried their gelato this time as well!
The Ocean Grey ($6.50) may look gimmicky to some, but if you like your earl grey, this is a flavour you should get. The earl grey flavour is strong yet not overboard, and it doesn't have this strong artificial floral scent. The milk base of the gelato is also good, giving a good richness to the earl grey flavour.
The Matcha ($.5.50) was really strong, almost too strong in my opinion. It can get quite bitter towards the end, but as a matcha lover, this is definitely not a problem to me! We were surprised to find little mochi bits within the gelato which added great texture to the ice cream!
For both gelato flavours they gave a generous scoop as well. Definitely recommend if you are around the area �",4
"Nomiya Izakaya @nomiyasg offers several dons and small bites, and they are all of great quality!
The Truffle Chirashi Don ($20 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) came in a rather large portion, and they were very generous with the sashimi quantity too! The Chirashi don came with pieces of salmon, tuna, hamachi (I think) and they were all so fresh � the rice was fantastic as well, as it had the right amount of vinegar and truffle oil without making it too surfeiting. The wasabi is also the freshly grated version. At its price point even without burpple beyond, it's definitely worth it.
The portion of Brussells Sprouts ($8.90) may be small, but each piece was packed full of flavour. The pieces were very well charred, as the smoky aroma was very strong without being bitter. The kombu butter used gave so much richness and fragrance that it was too addictive! Wished that they gave more �
Now this is one izakaya that I will be back again and again!",5
"Back at @runescoffee and I am happy to report that their standard is as good as always. I really believe this is one of the best cafes in Singapore, as it cheBack at @runescoffee and I am happy to report that their standard is as good as always. I really believe this is one of the best cafes in Singapore, as it checks all the boxes: beautiful aesthetics, relaxing atmosphere and best of all, good coffee.
I got myself an Iced White ($5.50) and I loved how it comes in a nice cup that actually helps the coffee to stay cold for a longer period of time. The coffee itself is very aromatic, boasting both nutty and chocolate notes altogether. It was very rich and stayed flavourful throughout the hour while I was there. The milk and ice ratio were also perfect.
I definitely see myself coming back here frequently, as long as I am around the area. Great for any occasion, you should pay a visit here one day!cks all the boxes: beautiful aesthetics, relaxing atmosphere and best of all, good coffee.

I definitely see myself coming back here frequently, as long as I am around the area. Great for any occasion, you should pay a visit here one day!",5
"Red Ginger Thai Cuisine offers affordable lunch sets around the biopolis area and I must say that their green curry chicken and tom yum chicken are both decent options!
The set meals cost $9.40 each and come with rice and a fried egg. The Green Curry, although watery, boasts lemongrass and basil flavour and had quite a kick. There was a decent number of chicken slices, which were tender. The mushroom and vegetable ingredients absorbed the flavour of the curry well. I just wished that they could provide a bit more chicken slices in the curry!
The Tom Yum Soup had a good sour and spicy punch, and definitely was great with some rice. It was decent and had some depth. The food here may not be mind-blowingly good, but is an option to consider if you are around the area.",4
"So glad to have tried the Iced Mocha ($6.50) from Tanamera Coffee today, as its quality brew made me happy!
A smooth cup of coffee, the chocolate and coffee notes did not clash but instead complemented each other well. It is not too sweet yet quite rich. The amount of milk and ice was also just right and it stayed flavourful all the way till the last drop!
Best of all, you can get 1 for 1 discount on their beverages using #burpplebeyond . Definitely a worthy cup of coffee I don't mind getting again!",5
"Aside from the soup minced meat noodles from Bedok 85, I do appreciate the rendition from this stall ($4/5/6) in Tampines as well! The soup is pretty well flavoured from the pork lard used and the noodles were springy. The highlight got to be their dumplings, as the meat within is very well flavoured with fried garlic. The fried garlic pieces in their soup were also fantastic, as they were packed full of umami. A comforting soup I will crave for from time to time!",4
"The Werkx Cafe boasts multiple activities such as leathercraft, candle making, pottery and more! They also sell some small bites as well as coffee which we were glad to try!
We ordered a couple of sweet and savoury options, such as their all famous muffins, sourdough toasts and pastries, as well as coffee drinks. Here are some of our favourites:
1️⃣ Garlic Croissant ($5.30) - the crunch in their croissant is insane! It was really flaky and buttery. The garlic spread comes with garlic chunks that gave so much flavour and umami!
2️⃣ Chocolate Muffin ($6.80) - we were very surprised to find melted chocolate within the muffin, which gave extra richness! It was incredibly chocolatey and I love the top crust of the muffin as it was crispy.
3️⃣ Iced Mocha ($8.50) - I was afraid that I was too sweet, but I'm glad that it wasn't! The aroma of the coffee did complement the chocolate well and it was definitely a smooth cup.
There were also some board games for you to play while you dine here! A cafe to consider in the region. Thank you @thewerkx for the wonderful food and @scalemicroinfluencers for the invitation!",4
"If you are looking for some quality Western fare, this is one cafe to go to. I find their dinner menu much better than their brunch/lunch options and decided to try more! They seemed to have refreshed their menu recently and here are the dishes I've had:
1️⃣ Chicken Parmigiana ($24) - the huge piece of chicken cutlet was tender yet succulent and wasn't too salty. The thick layer of cheese just made it even better, due to its added richness. Definitely one dish you ought to share!
2️⃣ Grilled Salmon Pasta ($23) - I loved the thick meaty piece of salmon given. It was fresh, flaky and the salmon skin was done well due to its crispiness! The al dente pasta is drenched in a thick creamy sauce which had the right consistency to cling on the pasta well.
3️⃣ Angus Beef Stew ($26) - the beef was very soft and I loved how it wasn't too gamey! They won us over with their mashed potatoes actually, as it was incredibly smooth and buttery. Wished we had a bowl of this �
Best part is that their food items are applicable for 30% discount using #burpplebeyond ! Sad they didn't have their brussel sprouts, as they were hella addictive. Will come back again!",5
"Always wanted to try the mochi waffles here, and I must say that it's definitely different compared to other shops that does it!
The mochi waffles ($8.50) were really soft and floppy, which is different from the other ice cream shops that do it crispy. However, you do get alot of mochi in each waffle, giving it a satisfying chewiness that was still inviting! The rich taste of butter is definitely strong in this one. Doughy waffle lovers will definitely enjoy this!
Their gelatos ($8.50 for double scoop) were pretty decent as well. Both the Matcha and Houjicha flavours were not too sweet and I could taste the tea flavours well. However, I do prefer their Houjicha more, as the earthy notes were much stronger.
Definitely a dessert choice when you are in Suntec City!",4
"Been a long time since I've eaten at this restaurant, and the quality is still pretty good! Here are the dishes I've tried:
1️⃣ C&C&C&C&C Pasta ($25.90 for main size) - yes their pasta name is interesting, but basically its filled with ingredients starting with C. This cold dish boasts of creamy seafood flavours coming from the crabmeat and lobster bisque! Pretty decent dish that is worth a try.
2️⃣ ""Hainanese"" Pork Tomahawk ($32.90) - I was surprised how meaty yet tender the pork cutlet was! The sauce that it's drenched in definitely reminds me of Hainanese chicken rice chilli, and the addition of fruit jam definitely made it interesting. It does not get too surfeiting because of that! However, there is still a slight pork smell that some may not like.
3️⃣ Waffles & Roe ($9) - an interesting dish, with deep earthy flavours coming from the waffles and seafood savoury punch from the ikura roe. This is a mix of sweet and savoury flavours that will open up your palette!
With their menu changing every 4 months, you can see the innovative elements in their dishes. Will be back to try more dishes next time!",4
"Old Airport Road Food Centre is home to many famous hawker stalls and we were so satisfied with everything that we ordered!
1️⃣Oyster Omelette ($8 medium portion) from Famous Old Airport Road Oyster: Now this is one oyster omelette you have to try. Without using any flour, their oyster omelette is full of egg and I love how some parts were crispy! Their oysters were fresh, plump and succulent, perfect with tangy chilli.
2️⃣Black Char Kway Teow ($5) from Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow: this is a long time favourite among many of the people living around the area. I like how their kway teow noodles were cooked perfectly, as they were still springy! Definitely a decent plate, with fresh cockles and a right balance of sweet and savoury.
3️⃣Spicy Lala Kalguksu ($8) from Wooga Jjajang: one of the newer additions to this hawker centre, their Kalguksu really hit the spot. With just the right amount of spiciness, coupled with a flavourful seafood broth, this is one bowl to get when it rains! The noodles were very springy and there was such a generous amount of clams given!
4️⃣Durian Chendol ($3.50) from Nyonya Chendol: Looking at how thick the gula melaka is, I know this is going to be a good bowl. With a good balance of sweet and savoury, this bowl shouts rich flavours from the thick coconut milk and gula melaka. The durian portion was also generous and it was very fragrant. Perfect end to the meal!",5
"If you are looking for a place with decent food and drinks, Cali Bar is one place to consider! We ordered a couple of dishes and here are some of my favourites:
Kurobuta Pork Loin Fajitas ($30) - this was the crowd favourite, due to the flavourful and rather tender meat, the smoky onion slices and guacamole that you can assemble in a wrap! Definitely 1 good fajitas that is good to share!
Baby Back Ribs ($36) - the ribs itself may be rather small, but it was tender and flavourful. The fries were even better. Light, crispy and fluffy, I think I can eat a whole bowl without a problem!
Baked Cheesy Nachos ($18) - this is one addictive snack. Crispy nachos with cheese, guacamole, salsa and jalapeno, this is one sharing dish that is great with beers!
If you are working around the area, this is one place to consider for after work drinks. Do note that it can be rather expensive, but I guess it's how it is in the Rochester area! Thank you @scalemicroinfluencers for the invite and @cali.singapore for the food!",4
"This fish soup stall does fish soup very differently compared to other establishments, and I must say that their rendition is absolutely amazing!
You have to get their black and white ee mian ($7/10), especially their large portion which comes with an abundant amount of sliced fish and fried fish. It may be quite expensive, but this bowl is worth the treat!
The broth itself is very unique as not only do you taste the deep savoury fish umami notes, you can taste a strong flavour of bay leaves as well! The bay leaves provided an extra aroma which is greatly appreciated. The sliced fish slices were also rather thick and bouncy which says alot about their freshness!
Their fried fish slices are a speciality here, as they serve them separately. I can see the reason why, as they had such a wonderful crunch! The taste is quite similar to fried fish skin and definitely as addictive as well.
I queued for about 40 minutes and honestly it was quite worth the wait. Fish soup lovers, please try this rendition and you won't regret!

"A posh Korean BBQ restaurant in a colonial house, @chingu.rochester offers rather decent lunch sets that you can consider!
I got the Stir-Fried Pork set ($17) which came with a variety of side dishes and soup. The stir fried pork itself is quite tender and definitely very flavourful! I love how the pot that it's served in is still very hot, which burned the bottom of the rice slightly, forming this crispy crust that is similar to that of claypot rice.
The side dishes were decent including the kimchi which isn't too sour.
Considering the location, the lunch set isn't too expensive and the quality is not too bad. An option to consider!",4
"Among the many traditional and retro shops around the area lies this new cafe that serves up pretty decent coffee with aesthetic industrial vibes!
We got the Iced Dark Mocha ($7) which had a good blend of quality chocolate flavours and aromatic coffee. Definitely a smooth blend but it would be better if the coffee is even stronger!
The Iced Hazelnut Coffee ($7) was also good, with the hazelnut syrup not tasting too artificial. The hazelnut syrup gave a good nutty afternote to the coffee without overpowering the latter’s aromatic notes!
One cafe I will consider when I’m here in Chinatown!",4
"I love my tonkatsu, and I’m glad that @onkei.tonkatsu quality tonkatsu sets are able to fulfil my katsu cravings!
The set for 2 available on Burpple Beyond ($39.90) consists of a variety of katsu that will definitely fill you up!
The Pork Loin katsu was very crisp, and the meat within was meaty, quite succulent and slightly tender. Although it was not the most tender I’ve eaten, it is definitely one of the better ones. The Fish Katsu was actually much bigger and better, due to its fresh, sweet flaky meat that was really irresistible!
The Ebi Katsu that comes with the set was very fresh and succulent within as well. The kaarage and fried oyster given were also so tender and flavourful that we wished there was more!
The set also comes with rice, soup and cabbage that is refillable, and I’m glad those were available to cut through all the fat from all the delicious fried meats!
Definitely a back I will be back whenever I have some katsu cravings!",4
"With fantastic quality food and huge selections of craft beers, this is one place you can consider for a good time with friends and loved ones. We tried a variety of dishes, and here are my favourites:
The Fish Tacos with Mango Salsa ($15) came huge, with a large piece of fillet which was fried to perfection, and a huge load of salsa ingredients. The salsa really complemented the fried fillet well, making this dish actually refreshing.
The Har Cheong Gai ($13) is a must get! Extremely crispy batter with strong umami, the meat within was very tender and juicy as well. Pair them with their spicy sambal and you know this is perfect with their beer!
Their Squid Ink Fried Rice ($15) was also very good. With a significant amount of wok hei, the seafood flavours and tender squid really made this addictive. Totally can finish on my own!
Definitely coming back!",5
"Recently I had a chance to try the afternoon tea set ($68 per pax) and I must say, the ambience, food and service is not bad but with some misses.
The set comes with a cocktail, a set of savoury dishes, free flow desserts and a choice of their selection of tea or coffee. Their savouries come with quite premium ingredients, such as truffle, crabmeat and foie gras. One of my favourites has to be the Unagi Kabayaki Bun, as it was stuffed with a thick slab of unagi that was beautifully seasoned and was very tender! The Duck Rilletes Tart was not bad as well, as the foie gras given was huge and rich. However, we all agree that the tart given was too big, and as it was very rich it would fill you up very quickly. The truffle brie sandwich was sadly a disappointment as it tasted really weird.
As for their desserts line, the selection was quite extensive and everything was not bad! My favourites got to be their macarons and their crepe! Soft and slightly crispy on the edges, the crepe was stuffed full of dark chocolate and hence was very rich.
All in all, their afternoon tea can be quite expensive for the quality they offer. Considering that Colony is one of the best buffet restaurants in Singapore, their lunch or dinner buffet is better preferred!",4
"It was my first time having rougamo, and I was so pleasantly surprised!
I had the Chicken Rougamo from @qin_ji_rougamo, and I was a splendid street snack I would totally get again. The crispy layered dough was stuffed full of chicken pieces which were really tender and flavourful. The contrast of textures coming from the crunch of the exterior and the tender saucy chicken pieces really worked very well. I can imagine the cumin pork version tasting even better!
As I ordered it as a set ($14.50), the set comes with cold noodles and a drink. The hot and spicy cold noodles indeed was flavourful and had a very strong kick, perhaps too spicy for me � I wished that the noodles was more springy though!
Definitely coming back for the rougamo. Good thing that it's just right outside Tanjong Pagar MRT!

"For the unagi fans, this one is for you! Recently I had a chance to try the Unadon Double ($14.50) and I was very surprised by the quality of unagi given the price point!
The Unadon Double comes with 2 big slabs of fresh unagi, which were thick, meaty and definitely succulent. It was a perfect pairing with their fluffy rice, which you can drench the sweet savoury unagi sauce on.
With most unagi don places selling such quantity at easily 1.5 to 2 times compared to the prices here, I really can see myself visiting this place often whenever I crave some unagi. Can't wait to go back to have another!",5
"Had a fantastic meal at Clovelly recently and we loved the vibes, the food and the service. From appetisers to pastas to all day brunches to desserts, we tried a huge variety and here are my favourites:
Calamari Rings ($11.90) - this was a very addictive sharing appetiser, due to its irresistible crunch and that the squid ring within is pretty tender. This is one dish you have to pair with their lemon mayo!
Spicy Garlic Prawn Pink Sauce ($21.90) - flavours in this is an intensive one; garlicky, creamy with a hint of spice. The al dente malfade pasta type is perfect for this one, as its uneven sides cling to the thick sauce well. Loved the bouncy meaty prawns as well!
Carbonara ($18.90) - the cream sauce for this one is much thicker than the former, and hence the Gemelli pasta type is perfect for this one. Very chewy, the pasta caught alot of the thick sauce within and I loved the rich meaty flavour with the great texture of the pasta.
Molten Lava Cake ($11.90) - this is a dessert that is hard to go wrong. Soft chocolate cake with an incredibly rich melty centre, this was perfect with the refreshing coconut gelato.
Thank you @clovelly.sg for the scrumptious food and @eatwithkeat for inviting! It was a splendid meal and I can't wait to be back again! I can definitely imagine having a great time with friends or a good date night as well!",5
"Although they are famous for their cold noodles or naengmyeon, I decided to go unconventional and order their tofu stew instead. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!
Their seafood tofu stew (~$16) comes with a variety of seafood ingredients, including prawns and mussels, all in this wonderful comforting broth. I love how their stew is much more garlicky as compared to other establishments, giving the soup much more depth and flavour. The portion was quite big and I was pretty stuffed!
The side dishes were also pretty good, although the selection is not as extensive as other places. Another quality Korean restaurant on my go-to list!",4
"If you are looking for Chinese bbq skewers, I feel like @bbqboxsg is really a good option. With an extensive menu and quality ingredients, it's definitely a good time with your loved ones and friends! We ordered the family set menu ($90) that can feed 3-4 pax and it comes with a variety of bbq skewers, appetizers and sharing dishes. I feel like it's quite enough for 4 and you get to try so many different varieties!
My favourite skewers got to be their tiger prawns and chicken, as they were so fresh, succulent and smoky! I loved how their skewers were placed on hot plates to keep them warm throughout the meal. The set also comes with chilli cucumbers, which were not too spicy and vinegary, and had a very satisfying crunch!
With many outlets across Singapore, this is one place to consider even when you have big groups! Can't wait to be back!",5
"Prices may be quite steep for signature fishball noodles (I got their $8 version) but I really thoroughly enjoyed it.
Their noodles were springy and very well dressed in their blend of sauces. I liked how it had the right amount of tartness from the vinegar and that the chilli isn't too spicy. The lard flavour is strong as well! A small downside is that I noticed some ketchup in the sauce, which made it abit too sweet for my liking.
The soup itself was sweetened by what I believe is pork stock, and there were many ingredients given. From bouncy fish balls to fresh pig liver to a fresh snappy prawn, I enjoyed all of them!
This is definitely a lunch option I would consider if I am working nearby. Will be back!",4
"From crispy cutlets to braised pork rice to noodles, Taiwanese food at @isshinmachi_sg was splendid!
We had the Crispy Chicken Cutlet ($9.80) to share and it was amazing. With a light crispy crust and juicy succulent meat within, this was addictive!
The Specially Marinated Pork Chop Noodles in Beef Soup ($13.60 with Guan Miao Noodles) was also excellent. The noodles had a good bite, the soup was not too savoury but comforting, and the pork chop was really the star of the show. The tender juicy slices of pork were flavourful and did not have much of the foul pork odour. This is much better than many Taiwanese diners I've been to!
The other dishes that we had were good too! Definitely a place I will come back again �",5
"Finally tried SBCD @sbcdsingapore and I must say, although the price point was high, the food quality served was excellent.
The LA Galbi Combo Meal ($42.90) may be expensive, but the amount served can fit about 2 average eaters. The LA Galbi itself was the show stopper, as the meat was so well seasoned and grilled. With a good smokey flavour, the meat was tender and succulent and I loved the sweet and savoury marinade used. Absolutely excellent! The tofu stew that comes with it is of a smaller portion than ordering it by itself, but it was definitely flavourful and very comforting. The seafood was very fresh!
We also got a Korean Seafood Pancake ($27.90) which was thick but crispy on the outside and fluffy within. A good sharing dish but I wished that there were more seafood ingredients used!
The side dishes served were all excellent, especially their kimchi which wasn't too sour and had a satisfying crunch. I was surprised to see a whole fish served as a side dish as well!
Definitely a good Korean food place to visit once in a while!",4
"Had a good tasting at @winemansion_aljuniedatrix recently and their food were pretty awesome! Here are some of my favourites:
BBQ Pork Ribs ($28) - the ribs were well seasoned and tender. I loved how the sauce wasn't too overpowering, and there was an additional hint of smokiness as well!
Crispy White Bait ($11) - highly addictive, this was the crowd pleaser. The whole fish can be eaten and it had such a satisfying crunch! We absolutely loved the mayo that went along with it.
Clams in White Sauce ($14) - if you love your seafood, this is for you. The clams were really fresh and it gave so much sweetness to the sauce it was cooked in! The wine sauce was also garlicky and spicy and went so well with the bread. We found ourselves mopping up every bit of the sauce!
They have daily special and lunch promotions, please check them out on the last few pictures � Gonna come back again soon! Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting and @winemansion_aljuniedatrix for the food!",4
"If you are looking for some authentic comforting Malaysian style handmade noodles, this is it.
@tastebukittimah serves up a several cuisines and handmade noodles is one of their main specialities here. I absolutely loved their dry version ($6.80) as not only the noodles were al dente, the sauce used was so satisfying. It wasn't too savoury but still flavourful from the good soy sauce used and the chilli wasn't too spicy. The money cai was just lightly blanched so it still has a bite!
Their soup version is good as well, as their soup has a lot of umami flavour from the anchovies used to cook the soup. Once again it isn't too salty and still very comforting.
You also can get their Moo Ping ($5.80 for 2) to pair with your handmade noodles! They were juicy and flavourful, with a slight crispiness.
Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting and @tastebukittimah for the wonderful spread!",5
"There may be many mixed vegetable rice around in Singapore, but @dilys_creation really does it differently. I got 1 meat and 2 sides ($6.50 with beef) and their beef rendang was really special! With a very thick rich gravy and very tender meat, I found myself going for more. It was really well seasoned!
I would like to give another shout out to their curry, as it was much thicker than your usual mixed vegetable rice stalls and so much more fragrant and aromatic. Definitely gonna try their curry chicken next time!
They also sell some small bites and desserts too. Will be back as this will be one of my office lunch options!",4
"Known for their murtabak, I've had their rendition since young and their quality really stayed roughly the same over the years!
The Mutton Murtabak ($7) was my favourition, with heavily seasoned minced mutton sandwiched between prata dough. The dough is slightly crispy on the outside and chewy within. Paired with their curry, this is one comforting dish I will crave from time to time!
Their Chicken Mee Goreng ($10) also came in huge portions. The noodles were well fried, as they were al dente while being very flavourful! The spice level can be quite high for this one, and it got me ordering drinks together with this � the chicken may be a little dry, but the marination was what got me going for more.
Definitely a place I will come once in a while to get some quality supper fare. Can't wait to be back!",4
"Picolino recently opened a new outlet at Shaw Plaza and we decided to check it out!
The Salmon Mentaiko Pizza ($28 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) was fantastic, with loads of rich mentaiko sauce and fresh salmon chunks. The pizza dough is also a winner to me, due to its crispy exterior and chewy dough within. A very enjoyable pizza!
The Gnocchi in Bacon Cream ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) was sadly quite a miss to us. The Gnocchi itself was perhaps too soft, and though it was rich, it was too creamy and surfeiting to finish. Some fresh rocket leaves might be a good addition to cut the creaminess of the dish!
Nonetheless, the pizzas are very promising. Will definitely try other pasta options in the future as well!

"Had such a wonderful meal at @haohaomalatang ! There were a variety of ingredients to choose from ($2.99 per 100gm) and a couple of delicious soup options to go for!
We had the Hao Hao Malatang soup base with small spice, which was really robust! We loved how it wasn't too spicy nor too numbing, and we could still taste the flavourful base broth. If you don't like spicy food, their pork bone broth is good as well! Not too salty but yet rich and flavourful, I found myself finishing it!
The ingredients were all fresh and I especially loved the lobster ball, as it loved the seafood taste and its bouncy texture! Definitely one place to consider for lunch when I'm around the area �

"It's been some time since I last visited @kookscreamery and I feel like their gelato flavours got even better �
We had their new Dirty Matcha Gelato made with Oatside oat milk with their chocolate lava cookie (~$13-14) and they were all so good!
The Dirty Matcha gelato had a very strong quality matcha flavour, with a slight hint of coffee. I loved how it wasn't too sweet and it tasted really decadent! Definitely one gelato flavour I will recommend to matcha flavours!
Their lava cookie always did not disappoint with the rich lava chocolate and the warm crispy cookie batter. What a wonderful pairing with the matcha gelato!
Definitely coming back to try more of their gelato flavours �",5
"Fancy some old school western delights? This is one place to get some quality affordable western fare! I had the mixed grill ($7) which had a piece of grilled chicken, a piece of grilled pork chop and a piece of fried fish cutlet and they were pretty good!
The fried fish cutlet stole the show as we loved the crispy light batter and the flaky succulent meat within. The chicken was tender, and had the old school peppery taste, due to the brown sauce it was drenched with. The pork chop was a little too tough, but still decent.
As for the sides, the garlic rice was fantastic as it was fluffy and extremely flavourful from the amount of garlic within the rice. Really addictive!
I can really see myself coming back here frequently if I live nearby. Will be back again!",4
"With outside seats and a beautiful river view, this is one good place to go for good Vietnamese food and vibes. We had a couple of dishes to share and here are my favourites:
Stir Fried Seafood Vermicelli ($9) - with al dente springy noodles that were nicely drenched in some kind of soy seafood sauce, we found this quite addictive. Seafood ingredients were fresh and there was some wok hei flavour as well!
Fried Spring Rolls ($6 for 5) - now this is the crowd's favourite. Crispy rice paper rolls stuffed with meat and vegetables that were well seasoned, this was also addictive and we ended up ordering more!
Stir Fried Bittergourd with Egg ($8.80) - the bittergourd itself may be a little bitter, but they were well seasoned and the bitter flavour was musked abit by the flavour of the egg! A wonderful sharing dish. It had abit of wok hei flavour as well!
I have been here a couple of times and their food quality remained consistent. All of the food we tried was great and of an affordable price and I can't wait to be back again!",5
"With good coffee and desserts, Humble Bakery is one place to come for when you are in the CBD area!
For coffee we had the Iced Mocha ($6) and it was stellar. With strong aromatic coffee and good quality dark chocolate, this mocha wasn't too sweet and it tasted decadent! It was a big cup as well and we thoroughly enjoyed the drink.
For desserts we had the Injeolmi Crumble Cake ($8) and the Brownie ($4). The Brownie wasn't much to shout out about, but the Injeolmi Crumble cake was so good! Soft moist cake was stuffed full of injeolmi cream that was not too sweet and had a good soy bean flavour. It was comes with a tteok within, which had a wonderful chewy texture. Very lovely cake!
Can't wait to be back! I'm already missing the mocha �",5
"Hidden in a golf course, @golf_spot.sg offers a wide variety of quality food options with a beautiful view! Here are some that I liked:
G-chicken Sourdough ($9.50) - stuffed full of ingredients, the croissant was crispy and complemented the grilled chicken really well! The chicken itself was tender, succulent and well seasoned.
G-Spot Cheese Fountain Burger ($24.90) - when given a huge amount of cheese, what's there to not like! The burger patty itself was pretty juicy and beefy, and was very satisfying with the cheese sauce!
Fusion Aglio E Olio Pasta ($12.90) - the al dente pasta were tossed in some kind of hae bi hiam (dried shrimp chilli) sauce and was pretty addictive! It was very savoury and garlicky.
This place is a great place to chill at and to escape from the concrete jungle. Please note that there isn't much of a pathway to walk to the restaurant, so driving here is definitely recommended. Thank you @smolbelly for inviting and @golf_spot.sg for the food and hospitality!",4
"One of my favourite coffee places, their coffee here really doesn't disappoint! Their Iced Latte ($7) was rich, bold and full bodied. With a slight acidity, the coffee had nutty aromatic notes which I loved. Switching to oatmilk actually made the coffee taste even better, as it wasn't so sharp but more like a warm hug around your palette. Very satisfying coffee indeed! The cafe itself is very aesthetic and a perfect environment to hold great conversations. Will be back again!",5
"Salted Egg Pork Ribs is one popular dish in zi char stalls and Three Meals A Day's rendition ($7.20 with egg) is really not bad. Tender pork cutlets were drenched heavily in a thick luscious salted egg sauce that had a good balance of sweet and savouriness. You get hit by a strong creamy salted egg yolk taste, then the aromatics of the curry leaves and spice of the chilli padi. This is best paired with rice and egg! If only they gave more of those delicious pork ribs �",4
"If you like your ramen really flavourful, Bonito Ramen ($20 with special toppings) from Hakata Ikkousha Ramen would be your choice. Made from bonito, pork and chicken stock, the soup itself had a deep umami savoury flavour. I got the normal tasting broth, and it's savouriness is pretty close to what I had in Japan. Very thick and rich broth that got me going for more! The large amount of spring onions was very much appreciated, as it made the soup not so surfeiting.
As for the noodles, I ordered them with very hard texture, and it had just the right amount of chewiness. The char siew maybe thin, but they were well seasoned and actually tasted somewhat closer to ham. Wished that they can go heavier on the seasoning of the marinated egg though!
This is definitely one place I will go to fulfil my ramen cravings!",5
"Now this is a handmade noodle store worth queuing up for. Hidden in Tampines 1 food court, the all famous @l32handmadenoodles serves up really awesome handmade noodles!
Their dry noodles are really popular and I can see why. I had their Fried Dumplings Ban Mian ($7) and the chewy al dente noodles were very nicely dressed in some secret sauce that isn't too salty but yet flavourful. Their noodle texture and mouth feel really is a notch above any other handmade noodle stalls I've had.
Now we move on to their dumplings. Full of meaty ingredients, the dumplings were crispy and were full of flavour! Even their soup is good. Although only slight salty, you can taste the anchovy broth. The egg drop within is satisfying too!
Definitely one of the best handmade noodles I've had. I'm so coming back for more soon!",5
"Saw a pretty long queue for this hor fun stall and decided to try! The Beef Hor Fun ($5) was silky smooth and came with a substantial amount of wok hei. The sauce itself was quite light tasting, but you can taste the egg flavour within. The beef slices were rather tender, but I wished that they could have been more well seasoned, as there wasn't much flavour. Their green chilli were satisfyingly crunchy and had quite a kick!
Not bad, this will be an option when I'm around the area!

Their buffet option ($22) boasts multiple meat options like chicken and beef and they also have a huge variety of other ingredients such as cheese balls and turkey ham.
1 of their marinated meats that we loved was the teriyaki chicken, which was very tender and well seasoned with a sweet and savoury sauce that is really addictive! Another meat ingredient that we loved is the premium NZ beef cut, which was incredibly fatty and had the natural rich sweetness.
Thank you @thaisedap and @scalemicroinfluencers for the opportunity to have this!",4
"I believe everything that you wish for for a hokkien mee is probably on this plate. @enjoyxiahkm 's rendition of our signature hokkien mee is really well done.
The stock used in their Big Xia Hokkien Mee ($15.80) is full of rich seafood flavour from the prawns and full of meat flavour as well from what I believe is from cooking pork bones for a long time. Wok hei within the broth is obvious as well. The noodles themselves were not too soggy and soaked up all that delicious broth well. There were thick slices of roasted pork, and they were tender and the skin was still slightly crispy! The 2 huge prawns were so meaty and had a nice smoky flavour. Topped with large crispy pork lard, there is a lot of flavour going on in this dish.
Now their sambal chilli is really on another level. While it does not pack much heat, there was so much umami flavour packed in their chilli. Definitely stir fried very well and it added another flavour dimension to the dish!
So glad that it's available on #burpplebeyond ! Definitely will be back. Absolutely lovely!",5
"Beauty World is full of Korean eateries and restaurants, and Ssada Gimbab is one that offers pretty good Korean fare!
The Soybean Stew ($13) was really comforting and extremely flavourful. Full of ingredients like onions and sliced pork belly, this was one hearty stew full of umami flavours. The only problem was that we wished for more soup as it was so good!
The Cheese Spicy Stir Fried Pork Rice ($15) came in a rather huge portion, with quite alot of melted cheese on top. This gave quite a good cheese pull, and it was so satisfying! The meat was tender and was quite flavourful while being not overly salty. This was pretty addictive and I can see myself wiping this clean!
Definitely one Korean eatery to consider!",4
"We had a couple of their cream lattes and desserts and we were all so impressed!
One drink I missed the most in South Korea was their cream lattes or eispanner, and somehow most coffee places in Singapore just can't do it the way they did it. However, Alice Boulangarie really nailed every element of it.
My favourite got to be the Alice Cream Coffee ($7). With hand whipped cream with the perfect viscosity, the sweet cream paired with the strong aromatic coffee so well. The rich milk flavour was so satisfying. This is exactly how I had it in South Korea!
The Black Sesame Cream Latte ($7.50) had an extra fragrant nuttiness to the coffee and it complemented so well. The Matcha Cream Latte ($7.50) was also good; the matcha was fragrant and strong. The sweet cream is really the highlight and goes well on all the drinks!
Now their desserts. They were really a work of art! We had the Scarlet Rose ($13) and Squirrel ($14) which were very contrasting desserts that complemented each other very well.
The Scarlet Rose was very light and refreshing, with lychee and raspberry notes coming through very smoothly. With a jelly texture in the middle, this paired well with the crunchy sea salted chocolate base below!
The Squirrel is definitely a must get for chocolate lovers. Extremely rich, you get layers and layers of very good quality chocolate with several contrasting textures. This will definitely fulfil all the chocolate cravings you have for the day. Absolutely lovely!
Thank you @smolbelly for inviting us and @aliceboulangeriesg for hosting us! It's truly a feast not only for the eyes, but for our hungry bellies and hearts too! Definitely will be back �",5
"I have heard a lot about this place about their coffee and desserts, but did you know that their food menu is fantastic as well? We had many and everything was so delectable! Here are some noteworthy mentions:
Charred Octopus with Butternut ($32): the octopus leg was very well seasoned with curry spices and was very well charred as not only did it have the smoky flavour, it was cooked just right as it was still tender. The octopus pairs well with the butternut puree, giving a slight sweetness to the savoury notes. A good sharing dish!
Tiger Prawn Capellini ($28): prawn lovers will love this. The al dente pasta noodles were well coated in a prawn stock reduction that had so much umami! With loads of garlic, this pasta dish was so addictive. The huge prawns were fresh too! Do note that this dish comes spicy by default!
Charred Broccoli with Tobiko ($15): this is one rich sharing dish that you have to try. With a smoky flavour, the charred broccoli was soft and well drenched in a very flavourful sauce. Flavours exploded and you get your sweet, savoury and sourness altogether. It is really a party in the mouth and I think even vegetable haters will love this!
Thank you @smolbelly for the invite and @aliceboulangeriesg hosting us! Desserts and drinks will be in a separate review! Stay tuned!",5
"When we talk about hawker food at serangoon gardens, stalls from the chomp chomp food centre will normally come into the picture. However, there is a gem in the lesser known Serangoon Garden Food Centre that you should know about!
This Mee Goreng ($5.50) here is really worth mentioning. With 3 rather large juicy prawns and several squid slices, the Mee Goreng was fried so well, as the noodles were al dente, not starchy and definitely did not have the alkaline taste. It was not overly oily, but yet still flavourful. The acidity from the lime helps to cut the oiliness further and before I know it, I cleaned up the plate!
A very well balanced Mee Goreng. This may be the best rendition I've had so far.",5
"Finally been to the famous Apollo Coffee Bar in Serangoon Gardens and I absolutely loved their coffee!
The Iced White ($6.90) was strong, not too milky and has that smooth nutty finish that is pretty unique as compared to other lattes that I've had. We had another cup that has oat milk instead and it enhanced the aromatic notes of the coffee before finishing up with the distinct malt-like flavour of the oat milk. Very very enjoyable.
As the cafe is quite popular, do expect abit of a wait! I waited for about 15 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. Will be back if I'm around the area!",5
"@whiskdom recently opened an outlet in one north and their bagels and coffee are pretty decent!
I had their Cheese Cajun Chicken Bagel ($10.50) which came with a thick chicken thigh that is seasoned lightly with Cajun spices. The chicken thigh was definitely juicy, but I wished that it could be more heavily seasoned. Pretty decent, but could have been better!
Their Iced Latte ($6) was strong and aromatic and not too milky. Quite an enjoyable cup of latte!",4
"[INVITED TASTING] Had a wonderful feast at 49 seats recently, and I'm definitely coming back!
With a large seating area, 49 seats serve up western food with some Asian twists. Here are some of my favourites:
Fish and Chips with Tom Yum Sauce ($19.90): love the light crispy batter, with the meaty flaky fish within � the tom yum sauce was not too spicy, and had the right amount of sweet and savoury flavours. Such a huge portion to enjoy as well!
Smoked Duck Aglio Olio ($17.90): not only the pasta was in a huge portion, they were generous with the smoked duck slices as well. Just a little spicy but very garlicky, the aglio olio was so addictive! So glad the pasta noodles were al dente and had a good mouth feel.
Salted Egg Popcorn Chicken ($11.90): when popcorn chicken is already an addictive dish, the savoury salted egg sauce added another dimension to the dish � I just kept on eating and couldn't stop all the way till the end of the meal!
With quality food, generous portions and reasonable prices, this is one option to go for when you're in town! Thank you @eatwithkeat for the invite and @49seats for hosting us!",5
"Saw this gelato place @freshiogelato with very high reviews and had to check it out!
You get to try out your ice cream flavours before ordering, and the owners do not hesitate to give you a pretty sizable portion to taste. I tried quite a few of their flavours and the hardest part is to choose among them!
I settled with Strawberry Cheesecake ($4.70) with their chocolate lava cake ($4.90) and had a separate passionfruit gelato ($4.70) in a cup. The strawberry cheesecake had such a good milk richness, with a slight cheese flavour that does not get cloying. The chocolate lava cake was gooey and extremely rich and chocolatey. Pairing these 2 together, you get a wonderful combination!
The passionfruit flavour had a strong tartness and was refreshing. The passionfruit taste was aromatic and wasn't artificial!
Absolutely loved the many gelato flavours in the shop. This may be one of the best gelato shops I know!",5
"A new pasta place in the Bras Basah area, Ameising La Volta @ameising.la.volta offers quality fresh pasta dishes that left me scraping the plates clean!
I loved the sauce from the Italian Carbonara with Parma Ham ($20 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) as it was traditionally made with egg yolk and cheese and without cream. Thick and rich, the sauce also had a deep earthy flavour from the pecorino cheese used. Stirring it together with the perfectly al dente fresh fettuccine, this was addictive. The Parma ham was fresh and not too salty, but the winner was the seared bacon pieces, which had such a wonderful meaty umami flavour. Love it!
The Deconstructed Pesto ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) may not look green, but you will be surprised by the strong pesto flavour within the sauce! The fresh linguine was thinner than usual, but still al dente. Fresh basil added a refreshing aroma, while the cheese shavings added salty and slightly earthy flavour. Also a good dish!
The Wagyu Fat Fries ($13) definitely tasted richer than normal fries, but the homemade mayo really was the trump card. With strong tartness, it was perfect with the fries! However, I don't think I will order this again, as I would rather try their other tapas dishes.
With a rather romantic ambience, this is good for a date night as well. Can't wait to be back!",5
"My whole family was very thoroughly impressed with @takeabakesingapore as their bakes not only look good, they taste really good too!
We got the Excavator design with chocolate sponge cake and we were so awed by their detailed design! Definitely one pretty cake to impress guests and children � the sponge cake within was soft and moist, and the cream within wasn't too sweet. Absolutely loved the chocolate coating as it was like a chocolate ganache. We could all tell that it's made from quality chocolate!
Thank you @ericiali for arranging and Zhi Hui @takeabakesingapore for the wonderful cake!",5
"The Mount Faber Coffee ($7) from M5 Coffee is definitely an interesting one. The coffee itself is strong and quite aromatic, but what makes this drink unique is the blue syrup they added at the bottom. The syrup tastes uncannily familiar to the blue coral ice blended drinks I used to get as a kid but milder. Stirring it well into the coffee, the combined flavours may not sit well with some, but I was quite okay with it. You get a fragrant sweet coffee flavour at the start, with the blue coral flavour intensifying after. I definitely would choose other coffee flavours than this, but this is something unique one can try!",3
"We had a wonderful meal at Torio recently, and I must say their food quality is really top notch!
Their Kiwami Omakase course ($138++ per pax) consists of a variety of cooked dishes, sashimi and sushi. From grilled fish to multiple sashimi courses, we were treated to many exquisite ingredients. I must say many of the courses consist of otoro, but I am totally not complaining as their otoro were so fresh and rich. Food wise I must say we were thoroughly impressed. Do not expect a very posh ambience, but do come down to enjoy good food.
However, there were things we weren't so happy about. They didn't allow us to sit at the counter seats at first as we didn't order the chef omakase sets which were much more expensive, but complied later on as we ordered a more expensive course set and they brought us to a rather quiet corner of the counter. I didn't get why we couldn't sit at the counter, as the seats there were largely available the whole afternoon. Definitely would have spoilt our dining experience if not for the wonderful food they served.
All in all, go for their good food without too much expectations!",4
"Hidden among the old HDB flats in Tiong Bahru is this new coffee place @glassroasters, which serves up quality coffee!
We had the Iced Latte ($7) and the Iced Taro Latte ($8.50). The Iced Latte was of a dark roast and the robust aromatic flavours of the coffee really won me over! As I chose the Ethiopian beans, there was a chocolate note finish which was delightful. So glad that the coffee was strong and did not taste diluted all the way till the end!
The Iced Taro Latte was surprisingly good, as the taro taste did not overpower the coffee. Instead, it complemented the coffee really well and gave a rich aromatic aftertaste. Definitely great for taro lovers!
The cafe space is small so be prepared! Definitely a coffee place I will be back again!",5
"A famous hot pot restaurant in the CBD area, City Hot Pot offers a wide variety of soup bases and ingredients! We had the Australian Rib-eye set (1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) and it came with a variety of ingredients!
For the soup base, we got the fish soup with milk and the prawn base (+$3). The fish soup base was quite light tasting at the start, but was adequately flavourful towards the end of the meal. The prawn base was very rich, full of seafood and shallot flavour. That is one soup base I couldn't stop drinking!
The Australian rib-eye itself was very tender. As for the carbs, you can choose from a variety, and we got the hand pulled noodles and braised pork rice. The hand pulled noodles just needs a minute or less of cooking in the soup for a wonderful bouncy texture. The braised pork rice was rich and hearty!
After adding on drinks, the total bill was about $72 for 2. For the experience and quality ingredients, I will be back!",4
"A new coffee place near Biopolis, @brashboyscoffee serves pretty good coffee around!
I had the Iced Mocha ($6), which was a smooth cup. The coffee itself wasn't too acidic and definitely complemented well with the chocolate within. The coffee wasn't too sweet and milky as well. However, I do wish for it to be stronger, so that I can taste the coffee more. Still, it's not bad of a cup!",4
"First time trying Chirashi King Kong's truffle rice and it's really pretty good! Their Chirashi Don ($14.90) may seem to be a small bowl, but it's full of ingredients! From salmon, to tuna, to swordfish, the sashimi pieces were pretty fresh. I wouldn't say that the quality of sashimi pieces were top notch, but they definitely fulfil my cravings! The truffle rice had a good bite and was very flavourful as well. Love the ikura as well, as they were bursting full of seafood savouriness. Overall, quite an enjoyable bowl �",4
"Had a steaming bowl of fish soup from @xinyuanji.fishheadsteamboat and it was comforting!
Priced at $9.80 for a bowl of double fish soup, this was definitely not cheap. There were quite a few slices of fried fish and sliced fish, which was greatly appreciated! The fresh fish slices were meaty and were naturally sweet. The fried fish slices were very tender.
Their soup was definitely light tasting, but you can still taste the fish broth within. I very much preferred the soup in their steamboat version, as the umami flavours were stronger.
Still, this is a comforting bowl of soup I might consider when I'm around the area!",4
"Finally visited @keensbagelry and we were so satisfied with the bagels we got!
The Garlic Salmon was stuffed full of scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and torched cheddar cheese, all sandwiched between freshly made bagels. The garlic sauce added extra umami and savoury flavours and the torched cheddar cheese really added an extra smokey dimension of flavour to the bagel. So satisfying!
The Truffle Chicken had a thick chicken thigh patty, which was tender and succulent. The truffle sauce wasn't too cloying and we loved how both bagels we got weren't dry at all!
With #burpplebeyond, you can get these bagels at $12 each. So worth it! Definitely coming back to try other bagel flavours �",5
"[INVITED TASTING] Had such a great feast at @1345mookata and we loved so many of their meats there! All of their dishes were very fresh and their marinated meats were all tender. As a garlic lover, their garlic marinated meats really stole the show for me as the umami flavours from the garlic was strong. They do have a huge variety of marination types, so definitely there is something for everyone.
Their soup base isn't too salty either and there wasn't a problem with the soup getting too cloying towards the end.
To wash them all down, their Thai milk teas were perfect, as they were rich and aromatic.
Loved how the whole area is very well ventilated and I didn't feel too hot and stuffy while eating. The smell from the bbq wasn't strong on my clothes either! Thank you @1345mookata for the food and @eatwithkeat for inviting! If I were to stay in the west, this should be my go-to mookata �",5
"Visited this quaint cafe hidden within HDB blocks of Everton Park and I will be back again soon!
I had their Iced Mocha ($7.50) which was pretty decent. The coffee notes were aromatic and the chocolate used was rich and it wasn't too cloying!
I noticed that their bakes were all so pretty! Definitely will be back to try their cakes and desserts� Loved the vibes here too, as it was cozy and perfect for a short relaxing coffee break!",4
"[INVITED TASTING] Tried a variety of fish dishes at @fishsoupparadise and here are some of my favourites:
Curry Fish Soup: this is one dish you have to get with rice! Loved the rich coconut flavours coming from the curry which is best drenched on rice � fish slices were all thick, fresh and succulent.
Fish Head Steamboat Set: this came pretty huge and it came with a variety of ingredients. The soup itself is quite light with a slight fish broth flavour, not the kind of heavy rich soup you might be expecting. Fish head slices were fresh and succulent too!
Seafood Soup Bee Hoon: loved that there was an abundant amount of egg in the soup, as it paired with the flavourful soup well! I do taste a slight bit of XO within, which definitely added another dimension of flavour to the dish. Seafood items were all very fresh!
Love that you are able to get a variety of seafood dishes here. Definitely a place to consider if you like your fish soup! Thank you @foodiecouplecm for inviting and @fishsoupparadise for the wonderful spread!",4
"A new coffee place near the Boon Keng area, I'm glad that we went to check this place out!
I loved their Iced Latte ($7), as it was a strong brew and was aromatic! Loved that it wasn't too milky either. The Iced Cuppa Joe ($9) was coffee with heavily frothed milk, which actually made the coffee creamier when mixed well. Quite an interesting coffee!
Their Lemon Tart ($6) was quite delicious as well, as it had the right amount of tartness and sweetness. Perfect with the cups of coffee!
It's quite a small space, so be prepared to do takeouts instead!
Hey Slow Joe @heyslowjoe
1 Tessensohn Rd, #01-10, Singapore 217701",4
"Back at @sarnies.sg to try their dinner menu and I find it so much better than their day menu! Had a variety of sides and big plates to share and here are my favourites:
Asian Beef Ribs ($32): this came real huge. Pull off the bone tender, you can just cut through the meat using a spoon. The meat itself is flavourful and it paired so well with the creamy mash underneath. This is a must get in my opinion.
Crispy Brussel Sprouts with Bacon, Almond and Capers ($12): this is really addictive. Well seasoned, the brussels sprouts were crispy and just had a slight bitter aftertaste. They sure know how to make vegetables really tasty � a must get for sharing!
Truffle Mushroom ($22): their pasta is pretty decent, with al dente pasta that was well coated with a rich creamy sauce. Truffle taste may not be strong, but it was still a pretty tasty dish nonetheless.
What's more is that you can get 30% off food dishes via #burpplebeyond ! What a great feast we had!",5
"Specialising in aged sushi, @takemitsu_omakasesg is an omakase one should consider! We opted for the lunch Takemitsu Omakase ($150++ per pax) and we were treated to many different varieties of seafood that I have not tried before. Their Uni Chiwanmushi was a great start, as Chef Peter San was generous with the good quality uni and torching it brought out so much flavour �
The sushi course of the set was really the highlight, as that's when the aging of the seafood shines. The aged sashimi slices were very tender, and had so much umami flavours. Each piece of sushi was unforgettable!
Their finishing piece of sushi, which is the uni and aged shrimp roll, was really the bomb. There was so much going on and my mouth was just bursting from the seafood flavours and creaminess.
Really a place to come for celebrations!",5
"Chanced upon this unassuming Shao la stall in 3838 Coffee Shop just opposite Bugis+ and was surprised by the delicious quality of their roasts!
We ordered their 3 kinds for 2 pax and a small bowl of lotus root soup all for $18. The roasted pork slices were very fatty and I loved the crispy skin! The cha shao or marinated pork slices were tender and I loved the sweet and savoury marinade. Roast duck pieces were also tender and flavourful!
Definitely a decent shao la stall as one of your meal options here in Bugis!",4
"One of my favourite minced meat noodle chains in Singapore, @chaoyuan_noodle really does it well! The minced meat noodles ($4.80) were very springy and well drenched in traditional vinegar and chilli mix that makes it addictive. The soup is full of fresh pig liver taste, which some may dislike, but it's thoroughly enjoyable for me! The pig liver slices were tender and did not have a very strong odour. Meat slices and meatballs were enjoyable too!
A satisfying bowl I don't mind having every other day!",5
"Came across this Sarawak Kolo Mee ($6) at One Ton Mee in Bedemeer Food Centre and I thought it was not bad!
The $6 portion was quite sizeable, with quite a few ingredients and a handful of noodles. The noodles were springy and well dressed with lard which gives it a deep umami flavour. The wanton, minced meat and char Siew were all not too bad too. Chilli had quite a kick!
It's not particularly amazing, but definitely a hearty bowl for you to get through your day. Definitely one dish to recommend if you are around the area!",4
"For all fish lovers, this is for you. Uohama is really a hidden gem many should know about! Tucked away in Clarke Quay Don Don Donki's food court, Uohama sells different variety of charcoal grilled fish. I got their Grilled Red Fish (Whole with set - $18.80) and it was a massive portion of delicious fish. The fish meat itself was really firm, juicy, succulent and sweet. The saltiness level was just right. Love the ends as they were slightly crispy from the grilling!
Somehow I find their miso soup really heartening as well. Pair this fish with their rice and you get a splendid meal!",4
"Loved the vibes and coffee here at @runescoffee! The cafe boasts a rather large space, with a cosy and relaxing ambience fit to hold good conversations �
I had the Iced Mocha ($6), which was really smooth and rich. The chocolate used was of good quality and complemented well with the fragrant coffee used. Splendid cup of coffee that gave me the booster I needed!
Definitely will be back to try their other coffee variations and food items offered �",5
"Probably one of the wettest hokkien mee I have had, Wu Ba Ye Hokkien Mee ($6) was unfortunately just decent at best. Although the prawns given were really fresh, huge and had a firm bite, the stock used somehow lacked the strong seafood flavour and was too sweet for my liking. Maybe the rest of the dishes they offer may be better!",3
"Had a fun time with @eatwithkeat @amazingkway and @smolbelly trying out a variety of bagels and drinks from @bagmeupsg and there were many that I loved!
The Sale-man bagel ($16.50) was stuffed full of smoked salmon and I absolutely loved the touch of dill with cream cheese. This is one refreshing bagel that I can finish easily!
The We Will Wagyu ($16.50) is one to go for if you love your meat. With a pretty thick and juicy patty, the beefy flavours together with the homemade sauce gave this bagel a rich savoury taste. I thoroughly enjoyed this!
Now their milk tea isn't any usual milk tea out there. You know they are serious with their milk teas when they do not come with ice so that the tea doesn't get diluted. The Ceylon Fresh Milk Tea ($4.50) was so fragrant and so nicely balanced. Such a smooth cup, I would come here just to get their tea if I'm around the area! Their White Peach Fresh Milk Tea ($4.50) is also incredibly balanced and aromatic and does not have that artificial after taste.
Thank you @bagmeupsg for the food and hospitality and thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting!",5
"Had a tasting at Wan He Lou recently and was pretty impressed with most of their dishes!
One of their most popular dishes is their Signature Lobster Porridge and it was really flavourful! You can really taste the lobster broth used to cook the porridge. I find myself going for more, though I wished that the lobster could have been more fresh.
Their Shrimp Roll is an interesting one, as they were somewhat coated with cheese powder that added some sweetness to the savoury roll. Definitely makes it addictive!
Now my favourite dish of the meal: Shrimp Paste Chicken. They were perfectly fried chicken wings, all marinated in this really strong shrimp paste that has so much umami packed within. Biting into the crust does reveal tender succulent meat. Just thinking of them now makes me hungry again!
Thank you @wanhelou for the food and @eatwithkeat @smolbelly for inviting!",4
"A popular dessert cafe specialising in tea flavoured ice cream, Ri Ri Cha also offers nian gao waffles which we wanted to try out as well!
We got the nian gao waffles with 3 scoops (~$20) and we liked the waffles! With a crispy exterior and strong butter taste, the chewy texture from the nian gao within was inviting as well.
We had Earl Grey Milk Tea, Blue Pea Matcha and White Peach Oolong ice cream flavours. All flavours were alright, but we liked how all of them were not too sweet.
Not too bad, a dessert place to consider.",4
"If you love a good spice, GOOBNE at E!hub is one place you can consider. The Volcano Cheese Rabboki ($14) came with a variety of ingredients, all coated in a very hot fiery spicy sauce. I love how the noodles were al dente, and the crispy cheese at the bottom of the hot plate added extra richness!
The Seafood Jjampoong ($14) was also another spicy one. The soup had a good kick, and I loved the umami coming from the rich seafood broth. There were quite a few seafood ingredients as well!
Would try their other non spicy dishes next time! These left my stomach burning for some time �",4
"I don't usually have my fish soup with milk, but this hits different. Their $6 fried fish soup was of a pretty huge portion, with thick fried fish slices. The fish slices were very fresh, succulent and naturally sweet! Their soup really was the winning card, as it was so robust with the rich fish stock, flavours all intensified with a splash of shaoxing wine and milk. Extremely lovely. Definitely a bowl I don't mind having every day!",5
"Been here for a few times already and the lychee raspberry flavours really don't disappoint! With the lychee flavour not being too prominent nor too artificial, it is complemented by the citrus raspberry flavours well. Definitely refreshing. I got it with the bandung cone, which surprisingly had a strong floral flavour!
Definitely will be back to try other cone and ice cream flavours �",4
"Back at Oven & Fried Chicken and once again fell in love with their dishes!
The Yangnyeom Fried Chicken ($23 for 7 pieces) was definitely the crowd favourite. Still crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, each piece was covered in a sweet savoury sauce that is addictive.
Jjampoong Tang ($35) was worthy dish to get! The spicy seafood soup had a rich seafood stock and wasn't too spicy. Packed full of ingredients, it was very comforting.
Pajeon ($25) was surprisingly crispy while being fluffy on the inside. With the soy sauce and some sliced chilli, this really gets addictive too.
Baked Crunch Chicken ($20 for 7 pieces) - definitely tasted healthy, but although the meat is tender and juicy within, I still prefer the original fried chicken due to its light and extremely crispy batter.
Definitely coming back!",5
"Back at my favourite tendon restaurant and their Special Mix Tendon bowl ($14.90) once again made both my heart and stomach happy!
There was a variety of ingredients, from prawn to chicken breast to an assortment of vegetables. All of them were well fried, as the batter wasn't too thick and it didn't taste too oily. The fried egg was gooey and was perfect with rice and some shoyu sauce �
My favourite tempura pieces got to be the prawn tempura, as it was huge and succulent within �
Do take note that there is a queue almost all the time! Do expect about at least 30 minutes wait during peak hours �",5
"Tried a large variety of dishes at @supplydemandorchard and I was just wondering why I have not eaten at this place before �
The Sinful Five Cheese Fries was one of the top crowd pleaser. Huge portion of fries with loads of cheese, this got really addictive. The cheese used were all of good quality and I loved how fluffy the fries were while maintaining a slight crunch. An ultimate sharing dish!
The La Marttina Dopo pizza was one of my top dishes as well. With a fluffy yet chewy dough, the pizza came topped with loads of ingredients including bacon and mushrooms. Seems simple but yet done very well.
The Beetroot Infused Cilbir is their Turkish representation dish in the Back to Brunch Basics menu, and it's an interesting yet delicious one. Combining avocado, beetroot yogurt, herbs and spices, it was rich yet refreshing at the same time. It formed a wonderful spread on their crispy garlic sourdough.
All of their dishes were really amazing and portions were huge as well. Definitely coming back! Thank you @smolbelly for inviting and @supplydemandorchard for hosting!",5
"Been here before but I was really pleasantly surprised that their food quality actually improved! These are the must order dishes here:
XO Fish Soup - their fish soup come with a really robust soup that has the earthy flavours coming from the XO wine, sweetness from the fish broth and richness from the milk. So addictive! The fish chunks are thick and really fresh as well �
Fried Prawn Roll - beautifully fried, these were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Not too savoury and accompanies the fish very well!
Prawn Paste Chicken - this is really the star of the show. Extremely light and crispy exterior with strong prawn paste flavours and juicy chicken meat within, this was so addictive! Really a must order.
San Lou Hor Fun - this comes generous with many fresh fish slices and I love how the hor fun itself is still chewy and silky smooth! This dish contains loads of garlic as well which adds alot of flavour to the dish!
Definitely a very good place to eat with friends. Will be back!",5
"Found a hidden zi char in the east that makes you feel like you are in Malaysia!
Beng Poh Eating House may seem out of the way, but their food items were pretty awesome! Here are the food items we ordered:
Salted Egg Pork Ribs ($15) - now this one really was the star of the show. Tender pork ribs, incredibly flavourful and rich salted egg sauce. Very well done.
Three Egg Spinach ($12) - this came in a claypot, and the broth was so flavourful! You get the extra sweetness from the red dates and the umami from the ikan billis.
Clam Bee Hoon ($10) - this was the medium size and they were quite generous with the portion. Thought not very heavily flavoured, you still get some smokiness and seafood flavours from the broth. Not bad but maybe we could have gotten it smaller and tried other dishes.
Will come again with a bigger group to try their fish head steamboat �",4
"May look messy, but this bowl of handmade noodles ($5.50, +$1 for onsen egg) is really slurp worthy. With the chewy noodles all drenched in some kind of soy sauce and pepper based sauce, I found myself quite addicted to the noodles! The minced meat and ikan billis portions are also quite substantial.
The soup base given at the side was unlike any other handmade noodle shops I've been too. It was not that much savoury, and more of the umami flavours coming from boiling anchovies.
Definitely a meal I will consider when I'm around the area!",4
"If you love your Japanese food, this is one buffet restaurant you don't want to miss out on.
The buffet itself is priced at $50++, and there were many options in the menu such as sashimi, grilled dishes, tempura, side dishes and udon/soba meal dishes.
The quality of the food items were actually pretty impressive! The sashimi slices were all fresh and the cooked dishes were all done well. Favourites got to be their salmon sashimi, as they were so rich and buttery �
Their grilled dishes were done well too, especially the grilled saba and salmon slices. They were smokey and the sweet fresh flavours of the meat really shines here!
Can't wait to be back!",5
"Had fried chicken and army stew at @basasakchickensg and was pretty impressed!
The Fried Chicken Wings ($13.50 for 6) came pretty sizable and I loved the crispy light batter. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, those were definitely darn good wings! We had the Soy Garlic and Snowing Cheese flavour, definitely loved the Soy Garlic more due to its sweet and savoury flavours. Pretty on point!
The Army Stew ($20.50) came filled with loads of ingredients such as tofu, ham, luncheon meat and sausages. The soup itself is comforting, and the sweet, savoury and spicy flavours were quite well balanced. Honestly I think this is pretty worth it, as army stew can be quite pricey in usual Korean restaurants.
Definitely will be back!",5
"Now this is one of the better satay places I have been to. The pork and chicken satay ($0.80 each) remained succulent and the smokey flavours comes quite strong. Tender yet slightly crispy on the outside, they were slightly seasoned but still flavourful from it's natural meat flavours. The satay sauce also comes with a small bit of pineapple juice, which adds some sweetness and tang as well. Lovely.",5
"Grilled Unagi Aglio Olio ($20)? I was skeptical at first but definitely left impressed. The al dente Linguine pasta was tossed well with garlic and mushrooms and were drenched in takoyaki sauce and topped with bonito flakes, which gave extra flavour and umami! The grilled Unagi itself was fresh, soft and flavourful. It was a sizable portion.
The Crab Mac & Cheese ($18) had a good amount of crabmeat and the blend of cream and cheese was really done well. You get the creaminess and it wasn't too cloying as well.
Get their pastas and drinks at 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond! We were indeed satisfied customers �",4
"So glad to be able to try such delicious food at @thepizzapastaprojectsg! The Pizza Pasta Project is a relatively new takeout eatery located within Stars of Kovan. We tried a couple of their pizza, pastas and sandos and we loved them!
The Truffle Temptation Pizza ($20) comes with a generous portion of cheese and bacon bits all on top of a hand stretched dough, and topped with slices of truffle � I really love how chewy the dough was and that the truffle flavour was not too strong and synthetic tasting. The bacon bits were so darn addictive!
The Hei Bee Hiam Tiger Prawns Pasta ($14) was my favourite among the many we have tried! The Linguine pasta was beautifully al dente and they were all well coated with a savoury, umami and garlicky shrimp paste sauce. Glad that it didn't have too much of a spice! The tiger prawns were relatively huge and were so bouncy!
The Bulgogi Short Ribs Sando ($13) was my favourite, as the beef slices were tender and flavourful, and the sweet marinade paired with the buttered sandos well. This kinda reminds me of a bagel actually �
Be sure to check out the food here, especially their pizzas and pastas! Can't wait to have them again � Thank you @thepizzapastaprojectsg for hosting and @smolbelly for inviting!",5
"Really found a gem at Changi Village. This Sliced Fish & Lala Bee Hoon ($5) is probably one of the best seafood bee hoon I've had because of so many factors!
From the fresh, succulent and thick fish slices, to the charring of the bee hoon and ingredients to a amazingly robust seafood broth, it had it all. Each mouthful of the bee hoon and soup just shouts flavour, due to the huge amount of umami and smokey flavour. Love the fresh crispy pork lard as well!
The portion came pretty big too! Really extremely worth it and I can't wait to come back to have another plate of this!",5
"Recently been invited to @newubinseafood Truly Singaporean Makan & Minum and this is a whole variety of US Rodney Strong wines! The food and wine were all really good �
Some of my favourites were:
US St Louis Pai Kut Wong: the meat was so tender and it was perfect with the sweet and savoury sauce. There was little to no pork stench which was very surprising!
USDA Short Ribs Galbi: this one really stole the show for me. Tender and extremely flavourful, the galbi pieces were also very smokey. The sweet and savoury marinade further enhanced the flavour profile as well! Perfect with the red wine selection.
US Pork Bak Kut Teh: there is really something with the US Pork ribs which made them so tender! The soup is really comforting as well and it isn't too peppery. The soup was like a mix between the pepper and herbal kind, which we all really liked!
As for the wines, the California Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were my favourites. Although they may be the lighter ones, they still had alot of flavour and was very smooth. Indeed lovely wines!
Thank you @newubinseafood for hosting!",4
"A relatively new cafe serving up superb sandwiches and sides!
We ordered a couple sandwiches, but I have to give an honourable mention to their Patty Melts ($17) sandwich. Juicy, beefy patty topped with savoury cheese and dijon mustard sauce and sandwiched between crispy grilled sandwic bread, this is one wholesome meal. There is so much going on I can't help but smile after eating this!
You can add on some sides to the sandwiches (+$5) and we tried their curly fries, onion rings and fried brussel sprouts. All were very well executed, but the fried brussel sprouts took the show with the good smoky flavour with minimal bitterness. Absolutely lovely.
Coffee is alright, the Iced White ($5.50) was not too milky and was quite strong.
I definitely will come back again!",4
"What a spread! The Gyoza set ($13.90) in Keisuke's Gyoza King comes with 5 gyozas, 2 side dishes, a soup, a bowl of rice and unlimited refills of seasoned bean sprouts and pickled vegetables. Really worth it!
Everything we had were executed really well. The gyozas were very meaty and juicy, perfect with the yuzu ponzu sauce. As for the side dishes, I especially loved the Eggplant and pork slices stir fried with miso, and the nanban chicken.
The Eggplant and pork slices were all very tender, and we loved how miso gave so much umami and flavour!
The nanban chicken was hot, crispy, so tender and succulent and perfect with the mayo sauce. This is highly addictive.
Really such a satisfying meal! We had nothing but compliments for all the dishes. Definitely will be back!",5
"A quaint coffee place in the heart of Chinatown, Plus Coffee Joint offers coffee with multiple coffee bean options.
The 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond offer is available for their Brazilian bean, and I got their Latte ($5.50). Not too milky, it was a strong brew and you can taste some chocolate and hazelnut notes. Not bad of a coffee! However, I do wish that there were less ice in the cup as it watered down the coffee quite quickly �
Will be back to try their Dirty, which is quite rare to find in Singapore!",4
"What's there to not love from a good bowl of fish soup? Hai Lan Ban Mian from Maxwell Food Centre allow you to put in handmade noodles into your fish soup, which is lovely!
I had the Double Fish Soup with Ban Mian ($5.50) and it came generous with thick fresh fish slices. The fish slices were so firm, bouncy and sweet, so satisfying! The soup was robust in flavour and had a strong fish stock taste. Together with the chewy handmade noodles, this hearty bowl definitely made me smile!
Hai Lan Ban Mian
1 Kadayanallur St, #01-76, Singapore 069184",5
"Really found a hidden gem in the bedok heartlands �
Thai Sabai seems to be a relatively new stall in the coffeeshop, serving up wok fried dishes. Their Fried Kway Teow ($6) is really a show stopper. Full of wok hei flavour, the noodles were so wonderfully springy and the prawns used were fresh too! It is also well balanced with the sweet and savoury flavours. Splendid! I was wolfing down this entire plate really quickly.
Their Crabmeat Fried Rice ($9.90) definitely seemed to have alot of potential as they were quite generous with their crab portions and the scrambled egg came pretty well cooked. Unfortunately, although the fried rice had some wok hei flavours, it lacked other sweet and savoury flavours, making it rather bland. What a pity though!
Definitely will come back to try their other dishes!
Thai Sabai

"[INVITED TASTING] This is definitely not your usual Thai food restaurant ambience, due to its very pink floral decoration all over the restaurant, which makes it pretty insta-worthy!
We tried a couple of dishes and here's our favourites:
Sweet and Sour Fried Fish - now this came pretty huge, enough to share among 3-4 people! The skin is relatively crispy, and the tangy flavours from the sauce complements the sweet, tender fish meat.
Honey Garlic Chicken - without being overly sweet, the chicken meat is relatively tender and the umami of the garlic comes through!
Papaya Salad - this taste exactly like the ones I had in Bangkok. It has the right amount of sweet and savoury notes, without being too spicy. This is one addictive dish.
Thank you @galangal.sg for hosting and @eatwithkeat for inviting! We truly had a wonderful meal!",4
"Recently been to nomiya to try their lunch sets and left with my heart and belly so satisfied!
The Truffle Chirashi Don Lunch Set ($21.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) came generous with different sashimi cuts that were fresh. The rice had a good amount of truffle oil and vinegar too! We loved this definitely.
The Aburi Salmon Don Lunch Set ($19.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) came generous with mentaiko sauce which was nicely torched for the smoky flavour.
All lunch sets come with soup and appetisers, which were delicious as well. We loved the fried fish cake especially, as the batter was surprisingly light and crispy.
Such an enjoyable meal! Definitely be coming back!",5
"[INVITED TASTING] A relatively new establishment, Baste has it all, food, ambience and vibes. This is definitely one place to go for date nights!
We tried so many of their tapas dishes and a few did stand out to us.
Potato, truffle bechamel, caviar ($13) - I love my potatoes, and they really outdone themselves with this one. The potato itself is creamy on the inside and surpringly crispy on the edges with a deep umami flavour. Flavours are then further intensified from the nuttiness of the truffle and saltiness from the caviar. This is really bloody good.
Octopus, sambal, cincalok ($18) - the octopus is surprisingly tender and not chewy. You don't taste the sambal itself, but a harmony of flavours from everything else. Just a tad bit spicy, you get the sweet, savoury and tangy flavours that will keep you going for more!
Roasted pistachio gelato ($7) - as their gelato comes from Hay Gelato, I already knew that their pistachio gelato will be good. Sure enough, it was very smooth and nutty while being not too rich. Love the pistachio butter on top, which once again intensified the beautiful nuttiness of the pistachio gelato. Definitely a dessert to get!
Their dishes are all in tapas sharing portions, and they are available 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond! Thank you @burpple for inviting and @eatat.baste
for hosting! What an enjoyable meal!",5
"Boasting a warm cozy ambience with soft music, cloud cafe is one place good to chill with friends and loved ones.
The Iced White ($7) came with a strong brew that has a good aroma. The beans they use taste quite chocolatey and the amount of milk used is just right.
Their cloud white ($9) is basically iced white with a layer of cream on top. The cream added richness and creaminess to the coffee that is gladly appreciated! However, it is quite expensive though �
If I am around the area, this is one cafe I will come by again �",4
"A humble shop hidden behind Maxwell MRT Station actually sells Taro Waffles ($2.60) which is quite a rare find! The waffles were really perfectly cooked to me, slightly crispy on its edges and soft and fluffy within. The taro spread was full of the traditional taro flavour, which is the sweet savoury kind with shallot oil. If I'm around the area, I will definitely get their waffles again �",5
"Loved the vibes in this Korean BBQ restaurant, as it gave quite a retro vibe and the food here is not bad too!
We didn't feel like eating Korean BBQ, and we settled for a Half Half Pancake ($26) and a Seafood Tofu Soup ($16).
The Half Half Pancake came really huge, definitely to be shared among at least 5 people! The best part is that it has a beautiful crispy crust that is so addictive! However, the taste of the kimchi for the kimchi pancake was quite light, and the seafood within the seafood pancake was chopped up way too finely �
The Seafood Tofu Soup was very comforting, and we were glad that it isn't too spicy. It came pretty generous with ingredients too!
There were quite a few varieties of side dishes as well. Will be back to try their meats!",4
"Tucked away at the corner of a mall is Unity Coffee, a small coffee stand with just a few seats.
We tried the Iced BLCK latte ($6) , which was like a latte dressed with charcoal powder. Their coffee is alright, but I'm not too fond of the addition of charcoal powder as it was grainy and hence did not give a good texture to the coffee.
Their mocha ($6) may be smooth, but I'm afraid it may be too sweet for my liking.
Perhaps getting their latte would be a better option!",3
"1 dish that never fails to make me happy is a good bowl of minced meat noodles and Fa Ji is one of those that I crave for.
Their $5.50 bowl comes generous with quite a few ingredients, but the stars of the show were really the noodles and their chilli sauce. The noodles were very springy and they were will coated with their chilli sauce, which is very much on the savoury side as compared to the usual vinegary tangy kind. The pork lard intensified the umami, and they were satisfyingly crispy!
Definitely will be back again. Lovely!",5
"Not sure if people know what Kothu Prata is, but it's really worth a try!
Instead of order your usual Plain or Egg Prata, you can try order Kothu Prata, which is basically prata but shredded, then stir-fried with some form of protein, onions and spices.
The rendition here cost $6 and came in a big portion. Not too spicy, you can taste alot of the aromatics and the texture of the prata is of the softer kind. This resembles very closely to fried kway teow! The protein they added to the dish is their fried chicken, which intensified the savoury flavours.
Really loved this dish and I will order it again!",5
"I'm sure most people know about their XXL pizzas, I finally tried it and their pizzas are really good!
The XXL pizzas came enormous at 21 inch size ($62, $4 top up for half and half toppings) and I loved how they used a thin dough and the crust was really crispy.
For half the pizza, we got the Diavola toppings, which is basically pepperoni. Absolutely loved the generous amount of cheese, and the wonderful fat and meaty flavour coming from the pepperoni slices. It does taste sinful but really flavourful �
As for the other half, we got the Buratta & Prosciutto topping, which to my surprise isn't too savoury nor too oily. I quite like the clean taste of the buratta cheese together with the really juicy and flavourful seasoned tomato slices!
The sides were okay, the Calamari Fritti ($18) were too chewy and the batter is rather unseasoned.
Definitely will be back for their pizzas though �",4
"Ordered so many varieties of dim sum from Victor's Kitchen, and most of them were really good! One of my favourites got to be their Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun ($5.30), as it was jam packed with salted egg custard which was runny and had the right amount of savoury and sweet flavours.
Another one that got me going for more had to be their Victor's King Prawn Dumplings ($5.90), as they had so much prawn meat within! Lovely bouncy texture and fresh seafood flavours came from the abundant prawn meat within and I was hooked �
Really satisfied with the different dim sum dishes ordered here. Can't wait to be back!",5
"[INVITED TASTING] We had a wonderful time at New Ubin Seafood for their Cervoles Wine Pairing session, with food and wine both carefully curated. The wine selection from Cervoles were outstanding, as they were all really smooth. Finally had wine that does not dry out your mouth easily!
The food selection were quite good and most were pretty delicious. One of my favourites had to be the BBQ Squid with Garlic Butter Sauce, as the intense fragrance of the garlic and butter really gave the dish so much flavour. We really couldn't stop eating them!
The Four Heavenly Kings Vegetables was wonderfully cooked as well, as the earthiness of the vegetable and the sambal belacan really complemented well. Full of umami flavours!
Thank you so much @eatwithkeat for inviting and @newubinseafood for hosting! We had such a great time!

"One of the more popular stalls in Holland Drive Food Centre, this Hakka noodle is one dish I will crave definitely.
The Hakka Noodle ($5.50 for large) came packed full of ingredients, from multiple daily available Yong tau foo pieces to fried wantons!
The noodles were springy, and nicely coated with a very traditional tasting sauce, topped with braised minced meat and cameralised shallots. The cameralised shallots were really the bomb, as they were bursting with umami and savoury flavours. Very slurp worthy!
The fried ingredients given may not be the crispiest, but they are packed full of meat ingredients!
The boiled Yong tau foo items were fresh and does seemed handmade. Love them with their handmade chilli which had a tang and quite strong heat!
Definitely will come back for this again �",5
"Had really solid coffee at Allpress' pop-up at 73 Duxton Road!
I went there while they had the 1 for 1 espresso coffee promotion, and got an Iced Mocha and an Iced Latte.
The Iced Latte was really impressive, as not only it wasn't too milky, the coffee was strong, very rich and had such a good aftertaste. It was really aromatic as well. Lovely coffee indeed!
The Iced Mocha was good as well, but the strong and rich chocolate flavours might have musked the taste of coffee abit too much. With their coffee being really good, I would very much prefer the latte instead.
Definitely a good area to chill and have good coffee!",5
"Probably the most traditional experience you can get, Geylang Lor 9 Fresh Frog Porridge really has alot to offer.
From having no menu but just pictures of available dishes on a side of a wall, to sitting on traditional plastic chairs outside on the street, it was really a kind of dining experience I missed. We ordered a variety of dishes and their quality was superb!
The Sambal Kang Kong was not only well seasoned and stir fried to perfection, there was actually a good amount of wok hei that gave the dish an extra oomph factor.
Oysters in the oyster omelette were fresh and the fried omelette was crispy on some parts and fluffy on others. Chilli sauce was sour and savoury enough!
The sambal stingray was really the star of the show with not only a meaty bite, but packed with smoky flavours. The sambal had a wonderful umami flavour and yet was not too spicy.
Now we come to the staple, the frog leg porridge. We ordered them stewed in a spicy sauce, and indeed they packed a punch. Frog leg pieces were very fresh and absolutely delicious. The sauce isn't too salty and was perfect with the porridge!
Loved the whole atmosphere and dining experience, together with the food quality and quantity. The total bill was $63 for all dishes ordered, which can easily feed 3 people. A reasonable price I would say. Do remember to bring cash as you can only pay for a few dishes using paynow. Definitely will be back!",5
"Brunches Cafe boasts a very cozy atmosphere with retro vibes that is great for fun and engaging conversations with friends and loved ones! The food and service here is really wonderful �
We had the Seabass Fish with Tartar Sauce ($22.90) which came in a huge portion. Beneath the slightly crispy skin is a really fresh, tender and flaky seabass meat! This is one dish we thoroughly enjoyed.
The BBQ St Louis Rib ($22.90) was mostly fall off the bone tender, just that the sides were abit overcooked. The meat is definitely very flavourful with the tangy yet savoury BBQ sauce. Sides from both dishes were great!
Both dishes were gladly available 1 for 1 on #burpplebeyond. This is one cafe I will be back again. Thank you for the enjoyable experience @brunchescafe!",4
"[INVITED TASTING] I believe it's quite difficult to find a halal duck rice stall in Singapore and they do it really well too!
We had their braised duck with both noodle soup and dry kway teow. The Braised duck meat was really tender and flavourful, with savouriness coming from the sauce and slight herbal notes from its marinade. The pieces with skin and fat were the best, as they were really rich in duck flavour as well �
Their chilli sauce is actually quite different from other places and I like that it has umami flavours and that it isn't too spicy. Kway teow noodles were cooked perfectly and still had a bite!
The soup given was comforting and had slight herbal notes as well.
Definitely one option I will crave if I am around the area! Thank you @kmshbraisedduck for having us!",5
"A relatively hidden cafe on the 2nd floor of a shop house, Rough Guys Coffee @roughguyscoffee offers simple coffee and some bakes.
The coffee were 1 for 1 on #burpplebeyond and we decided to get an Iced White ($7) and an Iced Cold Brew White. The Iced White came in a pretty big cup, and it was quite aromatic yet not too milky. The brew isn't too strong either. It's quite a good cup of coffee!
The Iced Cold Brew White was interesting. The coffee seemed to be slightly sweetened with honey, and it actually complements the coffee well.
A nice cafe to chill and have quality conversations!",4
"Back at Assembly Ground again for their burgers and curly fries!
The Bom Chika Wow Wow ($22) was a lovely burger with a thick crispy yet juicy fried chicken patty, 2 slices of cheese and was enhanced with richness from the truffle mayo.
The Assembly Burger ($25) patty was a steak itself and though it was meaty, it wasn't the most tender. It could be better seasoned with more salt and pepper as well!
Both burgers came with curly fries and my oh my, they were extremely addictive. Crispy yet fluffy on the inside, the fries were well seasoned too! I see why a person on another table ordered a big bowl all for himself to munch on �
Remember to use #burpplebeyond for 1 for 1 mains and ice coolers! �",4
"One popular cake shop in town, the cake we tried was of pretty good quality!
We had the Pandan Init (~$11.40) which may be quite expensive, but they did gave a big slice. The cake was rich, full of pandan, coconut and gula melaka flavours!
Instead of putting cream in between the pandan sponge cake, they put coconut shavings soaked in gula melaka, which also adds to a variety of textures in the cake.
The cream itself is thicker than usual, and I suspect they whip coconut milk with pandan juice. Lovely!
Actually looking forward to try their other cakes!",4
"My only regret? Not coming here sooner. BBQ Box offers a huge variety of Chinese BBQ ingredients on skewers and pretty much most if not all of the dishes we tried were really good!
Here are some of my favourites:
Shisamo Grilled Fish ($3.80 for 3 sticks) - perfectly grilled till crispy, the Shisamo fishes were seasoned well and full of flavour. Addictive with beer!
Pork meat wrapped with enoki ($6.80 for 2 sticks) - the umami from the mushrooms and the meatiness from the pork meat, all finished up with a touch of lemon squeeze really got us ordering more!
Bean curd slices in chilli oil ($7.80) - although this was a side dish, the texture of the bean curd skin paired with the fragrance of the chilli oil made this addictive. Actually quite spicy though!
The meal was quite affordable and we ate so much and it was about $35 per pax including alcohol. Can't wait to be back again!",5
"Explored a new place for lunch around my workplace and the food here is pretty affordable and tasty!
I had the Roast Duck Pasta ($9.90) which came in a pretty sizable portion. First mouthful in, and the duck fat flavours came in strong along with the umami from the sautéed garlic pieces within. The pasta is seasoned pretty well and the roast duck pieces were wonderfully savoury too! The pasta was done quite al dente.
This main also came with soup and drink, which made this plate of pasta really affordable! Decent food, no frills dining, affordable prices, they all got it!",4
"I believe this is familiar to everyone but interestingly, I actually never had this before.
This is the all famous Shiok Maki ($18.80) from Koh Grill & Sushi Bar, and my oh my I see why it's so famous. I got the gen 1 series which comes with unagi, and it's so generously drenched with some mayonnaise sauce and loads of tobiko. The fresh unagi and salmon pieces within, accompanied by the rich yet tangy sauce and umami from the tobiko, finally with the smoky flavours from the torch, this maki really lived up to it's name. Absolutely lovely. I had the whole maki to myself and it wasn't a problem!
The Yaki Udon ($12) was also good, with sweet savoury flavours and some smokiness from the stir fry. Love the chewy texture from the udon noodles!
Definitely back for more of the shiok maki!",4
"We realised that @cotta.sg do serve up interesting drinks and we had to try!
The Orange Osmanthus Cloud ($8) was really an amazing concoction. Refreshing citrus from the orange juice, paired with aromatic Osmanthus tea and topped with sweet milky cream, this drink was really addictive. Very smooth on the palette, this was a good refresher in the afternoon heat. Absolutely lovely!
The Cotta ($9) comprised of latte topped with pistachio cream. Smooth aromatic coffee with a rich and nutty taste coming from the cream, it was a delicious drink as well. The coffee was not too strong and is definitely for people who are looking for dessert coffee!
Seats can be rather limited, so there might be a short wait to try out such wonderful drinks!",4
"Back again for my favourite grilled fish stall, which is Uohama, located at Don Don Donki Clarke Quay's food court. I really believe this is a hidden gem as you get so much satisfaction and value from their sets!
The Hokke meal set ($18.80) comes with a whole grilled Hokke fish, rice, clam miso soup and salad. The grilled fish was really one of the best grilled fish I've had yet, as not only the meat was tender, flavourful succulent, the smoke from the grill is infused within too. Extremely fresh, I can eat the whole fish no problem. The portion can be pretty huge, perhaps the fish can be shared among 2 people!
Definitely coming back again and again whenever I crave for some good grilled fish!",5
"Heard about this famous coffee stall in Amoy Street Food Centre and got to give this a try!
I had the Kopi Peng Siew Dai ($2.40) which was coffee with less condensed milk. This was a superb cup of coffee. Extremely smooth, this coffee was a strong brew and wasn't too milky. The beans used were really aromatic too! This is actually already better than coffee from some of the cafes I've had!
I can imagine this being my regular cup of coffee if I work around here. Thank you for brewing such good coffee! @madroaster",5
"Made a trip down to Amoy Street Food Centre and I realised that this stall was significantly larger than others. Along with the long lunch queue, I decided to try their food as well.
I got the Beef Hor Fun ($6) and it was so delicious. The hor fun had noticeable wok hei and they were all drenched in this fermented bean sauce that has such complex flavours! You get umami, savouriness as well as aromatics from each bite. Furthermore, the beef slices were tender and some were pretty thick!
If I do work around here, I can see myself coming back for this regularly!",5
"Had a chance to go for the weekday dinner buffet ($78 per pax) and although there were hits and misses, it was still quite a scrumptious feast!
From lobsters to crab legs to steak and pork ribs, the buffet line consists of many premium items. The lobsters from the seafood line were fresh with a meaty bite, but the best were still the crab legs. The sweet crab flavours was strong from the fresh crab meat, and it was full of seafood umami as well! I definitely ate too many of them � Besides, if you would like the seafood to be tossed with some sauce like chilli crab sauce, you can do so as well!
As for the meat section, most of the beef options were too tough and the lamb chops were unfortunately dry. But the pork ribs had good smoky savoury marinade and was really tender!
The dessert options were alright. Love the service from the staff though, as they promptly cleared our plates and refilled our glasses.
Not bad of a buffet option!",4
"Hidden within the Everton Park neighbourhood is this pretty cafe offering quite a few flavours of gelato.
We tried a couple of flavours: Goma, Ju Pu, Pistachio and Bon Bon.
Among the flavours we tried, we find Goma and Bon Bon the best. The Goma flavour boasts a very deep black sesame flavour without being too sweet! Love the aromatics coming from this gelato and it makes us go for more!
The Bon Bon flavour reminds me alot of Ferrero Rocher, due to its rich chocolate and hazelnut flavours. There are bits of chocolate and fresh nuts which gave a great texture to the ice cream too.
However, the pistachio and Ju Pu flavours were just okay.
If you are around the area in Tanjong pagar, this is one cafe to go for!",4
"I have tried many of Keisuke's outlets and finally tried Tori King! I had the Rich Soup Ramen with flavoured egg ($14.90) which came with this really creamy soup that I adore. Although this is lighter than their Tonkutsu broth version, you still get alot of umami flavours from this. If you love a richer soup, I would recommend getting thick broth instead!
As I ordered very hard noodle texture, the noodles had a wonderful chew. The chicken itself was quite a big portion, and it was soft, tender and succulent.
Definitely a good bowl of ramen, but I would still default back to my favourite Tonkutsu broth!",5
"A humble stall in Lau Pa Sat, Butter & Cream offers a range of muffins that do make a good snack or breakfast item!
The Hokkaido Cream Muffin ($2.90) was one of the better muffins, as not only it was moist and not too sweet, it was packed full of custard filling which had a rich milk and egg taste! Might be sinful, but really decent.
The Chocolate Muffin ($2.60) was also moist and rich and not too sweet. If this was a lava muffin, I can imagine how much better it would be!
The Blueberry Muffin ($2.60) was alright, wish there were more blueberry fillings within!
Overall, the muffins were pretty decent but not really spectacular. Still snackable though!",4
"Had their 4 Wings Bundle ($9.30 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) for takeaway and they were really pretty decent!
We had all their flavours and my favourite is the Soy Garlic. Heavily seasoned with umami and garlic flavours, these crispy wings got me licking my fingers!
The Korean BBQ flavour is good as well if you can handle some spice. The sauce seems uncannily familiar to that of the spicy samyang sauce! Very spicy but shiok at the same time.
The Honey Mustard and Black Pepper flavours were just okay.
Wouldn't say their wings are one of the best I've had, but they are still of some quality. A bargain with the #burpplebeyond!",4
"Among the many stalls in Lau Pa Sat is this stall called Seng Kee Local Delights, which serves up pretty decent fare!
The Char Kway Teow ($4.80) was really pretty decent with a more savoury kick than a sweet one. The cockles were quite fresh too! There is a bit of smokiness within as well. Downside is that it wasn't hot and it seems like the cockles and fish cake were not fried together with the noodles. What a pity as this really has quite a potential!
The hokkien mee ($6) on the other hand was made to order, and we loved the savoury rich seafood broth which got us going for more! The portion is quite big and the prawns were fresh. If I'm in Lau Pa Sat I will come back for this!",4
"[INVITED TASTING] Spicy Grilled Fish is something I will crave once in a while, and I'm glad @kaogeyu offers quality grilled fish sets!
The single person set ($28) consist of 1 seabass grilled fish, a couple of ingredients, a small side dish and a drink. The portion is definitely enough for 2 to share so bring a buddy along!
The Signature Sichuan Pepper Grilled Fish is quite meaty and really fresh. The spiciness level is just alright, it won't kill you, but definitely packs a punch. You can taste the sweetness of the fish through the savouriness of the soup base, which I really enjoy! Definitely very comforting especially during rainy weather.
The Mala Scallop Shrimp ($19.80) is worth a mention as well, as the seafood items were fresh and the sauce they were drenched in is simply amazing! Just the right amount of savouriness with a huge amount of garlic flavours coming through. The only downside is probably the steep price point!
To finish off, their Osmanthus Sanxian Bing Fen ($5.80) was so refreshing! Not too sweet at all, the fragrance from the Osmanthus comes through strong and complements well with the other ingredients in the dish. If I'm around the area, I would just come to this place for this dessert!
Thank you @kaogeyu for hosting and @eatwithkeat for inviting. Lovely meal indeed and I will be back!",5
"Hidden in a quiet neighbourhood lies home cafe, which boasts a very simple yet aesthetic look. With comfortable seats and plugs around, I really can see myself working here!
We had a scoop of cranberry yakult ice cream ($5.50) which seemed more like yoghurt instead. With sour punches coming from both the yoghurt and cranberry, it's really refreshing!
We also had the yuzu osmanthus cake ($6) and this really was a winner. Soft moist cake texture, aromatic osmanthus flavours with a tinge of tangy yuzu, the flavour of the cake is very balanced. I can have this all by myself!",4
"Ordered El Carbon for dinner takeaway, and was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of their mains!
One worthy mention got to be their Grilled Lamb Chop with Chicken Sausage ($19.80 with soup, 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). The lamb chops may appear dry, but they were really tender and very well seasoned without much gamey flavour. They have managed to infuse so much smoky char flavour in the meat and that itself was really wonderful! The black pepper sauce has the right amount of savouriness and pepper flavours and complemented well with the lamb chops.
The chicken sausage also has a significant char flavour which makes it addictive as well!
The aglio olio was al dente and very garlicky. It may be abit too salty, but still enjoyable nonetheless.
Quality hawker western food indeed!",4
"Always been impressed by the food cooked by the different refuel cafes and once again I left feeling satisfied!
The Salmon Pesto Scramble ($15.50) came generous with a huge portion of perfectly cooked pesto scrambled eggs under crispy and fluffy toast. The pesto scrambled eggs were really fluffy too, with a fragrant taste coming from the pesto within. The smoked salmon pieces also accompanied the toast really well! Love the tang from the lemon slice too, as it made the dish more refreshing.
The Porky Egg Waffle ($15.50) also came generous with pulled pork slices which were very well seasoned. Neither too salty nor too sweet, the pulled pork pieces were quite addictive on its own! The waffle itself is the soft and fluffy kind and its sweetness complements the savouriness of the pulled pork well. With some perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, I really couldn't ask for more!
I definitely wiped my plate clean! Can't wait to be back to try more dishes �",5
"May be a hard find around Ngee Ann City to get to this cafe, but it's worth it!
The Iced Mocha ($6.50) had a good balance of rich chocolate flavours and aromatic coffee. Although the chocolate syrup isn't smooth, the residue was not painful for the throat and yet gave a burst of deep dark chocolate flavours as they melt quickly in my mouth. I actually quite enjoy that �
The Macadamia Latte ($7) gave a nutty fragrance to the coffee and I was surprised that it didn't taste too artificial and instead complemented really well with the coffee.
Definitely loved their coffee here and will be back!",4
"Heard about the good quality of food here in Wine & Kitchen and sure enough it was great!
We had the Cajun Grilled Chicken ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and chicken was tender, succulent and best of all, very beautifully seasoned with herbs and spices. The portion is quite big as well, and the fries were pretty moreish, considering how fluffy the insides were.
The Catch of the Day ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was also good, as the fish meat within was sweet and meaty, and were coated with a light crispy batter. This doesn't taste too oily, although you get a heaping amount of fries too!
The service is pretty good here as well, as they constantly refilled my water. With #burpplebeyond it's really worth it!",4
"If you love your Matcha, this is one option to go for. The Maccha Canapé ($10.99) consist of a variety of Matcha themed desserts, and you get soft serves, tarts and even cakes within this set. The Matcha flavour can be quite strong in many of the desserts here, especially their soft serve!
But I must say, their milk soft serve is really on another level. Although abit too sweet, the fragrance of the milk is really strong. Very lovely flavours from the milk soft serve and it pairs beautifully with the Matcha one.
We had the Matcha Latte with the milk soft serve as well ($5.40) and was refreshing too. Once again the milk soft serve made the dessert drink so much tastier!
Will be back!",4
"A very popular grilled fish restaurant in town, we finally made our way over to try their dishes and I can see why there is always a long line for their grilled fish!
We had the Akauo Hiraki ($20.50), which came in a generous portion. The fish was quite sizable and was really fresh. Very meaty and flaky, each bite was really rich and savoury. However, I must say, they may have seasoned the fish abit too much, as it got too salty towards the end. Really need to have loads of tea and rice with this!
The Mero Shioyaki ($21.90) was very interesting, as the meat of the fish was really soft yet surpringly sweet. Although a rather small piece of fish, it was full of flavour. If you have a sweeter palate, this is for you!
Will be back to try other variations of their grilled fish!",4
"A relatively new bubble tea store, Cha Yu Fan Hou is now in Pasir Ris.
We got the Earl Grey Milk Tea with Brown Sugar Pearls ($5.90 large cup 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Passion Fruit Green Tea ($5.40 large cup 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). The Earl Grey Milk Tea had a good fragrance without being too strong. Brown sugar pearls were chewy, but they were too sweet towards the end. 0% sugar option will be good with the brown sugar pearls!
The Passion Fruit Green Tea was light, quite sour and refreshing. Getting 0% sugar for this was a good choice! Pretty decent drinks and might just be worth it with the 1 for 1 on #burpplebeyond!",4
"Knowing that @whiskingbakes is a taro specialty cafe, we couldn't resist but go and try the taro coffee and desserts!
The Taro Eispanner ($6.50) is basically made of taro whipped cream with Americano coffee. The Taro cream is has a slight hint of taro flavour and it made the coffee rich. The combination does work, but we wished that the coffee isn't too sour.
The Black Sesame Latte ($6.50) may be quite a big cup, but we wished that there was less milk so that the coffee flavours can be more pronounced. The black sesame flavour is there.
Their desserts definitely don't disappoint at all. The Taro Mochi Swiss Roll ($6.50) is soft and fluffy, and the cream has strong taro flavour and isn't too rich or sweet. Best of all, the mochi adds a wonderful chewy texture and great mouthfeel. Splendid.
This place definitely has alot of potential and I do recommend coming down to try their taro desserts!",4
"Aw's rendition of minced pork noodles is actually quite different from other BCM stalls. Their noodles were all generously coated with their chilli sauce and vinegar and it was really quite spicy! The taste of their chilli sauce seems like those in KL chilli ban mian. Though flavourful, I still preferred the usual BCM with chilli that is full of dried shrimp flavours. Their signature noodles bowl may be $5.50, but they come with quite a few ingredients like prawn, abalone, clams(?) and fish dumpling. Still not bad of a bowl though!",4
"A relatively new cafe, SPACE coffee boasts a large simple cafe space. Once you enter the cafe, you will be greeted by a strong coffee aroma, which is really inviting.
We had an Iced latte ($7) and an Iced Mocha ($8). The Iced Latte was strong and aromatic, without being too milky; just the way I like it. The Iced Mocha was also very chocolatey, but can be quite sweet.
If you are around the area this is one place to come to hide away from the shine or the rain!

"One of the more popular Chinese restaurants around the area, long snaking lines were quickly formed and after tasting the food, I can really see why.
All food dishes were really tasty and I would think their main selling point is the homely flavours. The savouriness of all dishes were very balanced and no flavours were too strong. You can tell all ingredients were really fresh!
Everyone's favourite was the Stir Fried Potato, Eggplant and peppers ($8), as the sauce had so much garlic and the ingredients were cooked so well. Best with rice!
The Sweet and Sour Pork ($14) was also very tasty, with a crispy batter and soft tender meat within. The sauce was very balanced. They gave quite a few pieces for the price paid too!
Lovely dishes! Will be back soon. Totally recommend for bigger groups to try more dishes. Do reserve in advance first though!",5
"Saw so many people having this mama hotpot and I was so happy I had this!
The mama hotpot for 2 pax ($23) came generous with many ingredients such as large prawns, squid and mussels. All seafood ingredients were fresh and we especially loved the prawns as they were so plump and juicy!
The soup is notable as well due to its robust and rich profile while being not really spicy. I can imagine this being really lovely in a rainy weather, slurping all noodles together with it! The runny egg yolk with the noodles just makes it even better �
Definitely coming back to have this again �",5
"Finally had a chance to try this pretty fancy restaurant!
Their $35 3 course lunch menu consist of a starter, main and dessert. For the starters we had their Garlic Escargot and Chicken Pate. The Garlic Escargot were okay but we hoped that it can be more garlicky. The chicken pate was really rich and went well with the bread given. It can be quite surfeiting so it's best to share with others!
As for the mains we got the Angus Ribeye and Lamb Chops. The Angus Ribeye was tender and well seasoned and I loved how the compound butter added extra richness to the steak!
The lamb chops were tender and well seasoned as wdll, but the gamey flavour was quite strong. Perhaps lamb lovers will appreciate it better!
Desserts were okay, nothing much to shout out about. The food was overall alright but the ambience is definitely date night worthy!",3
"[INVITED TASTING] Had a chance to try their weekday lunch menu and we were all impressed!
Side dishes are important in every Korean restaurant and the variety in Wang Dae Bak was amazing! All 6 side dishes given were well cooked well definitely appetising.
The Steamed Pork Belly Set ($21) was definitely the crowd's favourite, as the set had thick pork slices that were so tender and succulent. The fat renders almost immediately as it enters your mouth and don't really have to chew much! This is best paired with the rice given. The rice in the interesting bowl was really sweet and fluffy and I found myself eating it on its own!
The Bulgogi Combo Set ($17) came in a large portion and I love how the set consist of a kimchi stew and a generous portion of bbq beef slices. The beef slices were quite tender, not dry and definitely flavourful. The stew was comforting and not too sour. Definitely getting the best of both worlds with this set.
The Small 2pc pancake ($5) was another dish that I was impressed too. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, these small pancakes were very flavourful and addictive. Lovely pancake texture that I adore!
Definitely very impressed with their lunch sets. Can't wait to be back!",5
"Have heard about this western stall selling pretty good pizzas and finally got a chance to try!
We got the Pancetta pizza ($19 for 12 inch) and it came pretty sizable and maybe too much rocket leaves � you can still taste the lovely savoury flavour from the Pancetta beneath and from the tender meatballs as well! The crust is rather chewy and quite enjoyable. Not bad of a pizza!
We also ordered the Braised Angus Beef in a calzone ($27) and this was enjoyable too. Really tender beef chunks were hidden within the crust, and we liked how saucey the dish was. Definitely very filling too!
Not bad of a pizza place in a hawker centre!",4
"Had a family dinner at this famous zi char restaurant to try some of their dishes and first thing you notice is that their portions are enormous. We believe their large portion can feed 8-10 people!
One of their signature got to be their Fermented Pork Belly ($30 for large portion). With a crispy crust, this succulent pieces were tender and packed with lots of umami coming from the fermented marination. Very addictive, these were delicious with their chilli sauce!
Their Crispy Chicken with Salted Egg ($30 for large portion) was also satisfying and all of them were generously coated with rich salted egg sauce that is perfect with rice! However, their chicken pieces come with small pieces of bone which was uninviting, maybe it's to show diners that they use fresh chicken �
Another specialty is their Seafood Mee Goreng ($20 for large portion) which was so flavourful from the chilli and tomato base and they came with quite generous portions of seafood. Their prawns were really plump and meaty, absolutely delicious.
Definitely a good place for family dinners!",5
"Rosti from a hawker? Yes please!
We had the Creamy Mushroom Chicken Rosti ($10.90) and the Signature Saigon Pork Rosti ($11.90). The rosti itself has a good crispy crust with a soft texture within. Love how the potato taste is really strong! But I do wish that the crust can be thicker. Perfect with the sour cream provided! The chicken is well marinated and quite tender. The sauce reminds me of the old school mushroom sauce from the neighbourhood western stalls. Pretty satisfying with the chicken!
The Saigon Pork cutlet was tender and well seasoned with some kind of Vietnamese marinade. Wish there was so sauce to pair it though! The pickled vegetables was an interesting twist to pair with the rosti!
An option to consider when you're around the area definitely!",4
"Found this interesting coffee place with cream coffee and I must say their version of coffee is really unique!
We got the sea salt cream coffee ($6) which is like an Americano topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with sea salt flakes. Their whipped cream isn't the ones that come out of a spray can, but instead they are hand whipped fresh by the staff. The whipped cream consistency isn't too hard nor too runny, and it really was perfect with the aromatic coffee beneath! This makes the refreshing Americano richer and yet not too surfeiting. The sprinkle of sea salt flakes was an interesting touch, as the savouriness comes quite strong in the aftertaste.
Im sure their other cream coffee such as the black sesame one will be even better and I am already looking forward to try soon �

"Hidden within the industrial area, Cafe Limonci boast a big space with comfortable and cozy vibes. Coupled with jazz music in the background and good coffee, this is one beautiful place for quality conversations.
I had their Iced White ($6.50) and it was an aromatic blend, with chocolate and nutty notes coming in well. It is not too milky and really just right. Definitely a good brew!
Love the young crew behind the counters greeting each customer with a smile. Their service really does completes the experience.
Lovely cafe. Will be back to try their other coffee variations!

"[INVITED TASTING] Tried quite a few dishes from this zi char stall located in a humble neighbourhood and both of their versions of hor fun are dishes to look out for!
The Seafood Hor fun ($5) had silky smooth kway teow noodles that had some wok hei flavours infused in them and the noodles were all generously drenched in a thick flavourful garlicky sauce. This is one dish that got me slurping!
Their Dry Fried Hor Fun ($5) is a dish to consider as well, with the savoury flavours being much stronger. You get the same wok hei flavour as well, and we loved how the splash of lime juice cuts the greasiness of the dish and we cleared it within minutes!
If you prefer rice, their Salted Egg Chicken Rice ($8) is not bad as well. With each piece of fried chicken pieces generously coated with their thick flavourful salted egg yolk sauce, I found myself going for more.

"[INVITED TASTING] I love my burgers and fries and my oh my this place does both so well. Now I know why my friends are raving about this place. I'm already looking forward to my next trip here.
We had a variety of their burgers. From beef to chicken to plant based patties they all have them!
The Classic Cheese ($13.90) came huge with an incredibly juicy patty with a wonderful crust. Biting into this burger greets you with an explosion of flavours from beef fat, to smoky flavours from the crust to the savoury gooey cheese. Love how tender and flavourful their beef patty is. To add even more flavour, there is a thick layer of caramelised onions to give it extra sweetness. I am so glad the burger bun isn't too doughy too! Definitely one of my top rated cheeseburgers ever.
The Pulled Chick ($12.90) was interesting as usually pork is used. Nonetheless, the generous amount of pulled chicken were very well seasoned with some kind of smoky bbq sauce that is both sweet and savoury at the same time! Love the coleslaw within the burger as it makes the burger not too greasy. Very delightful burger indeed.
The Thic Chick ($11.90) is once again another enormous burger and it did live up to its name. The crispy chicken meat with incredibly thick yet juicy. I was surprised by how light and crispy the batter was! Once again another good burger.
The Impossible Meal ($16.90) boast a well seared plant based patty that was surprisingly meaty. Even though there was no meat used, its still a wonderful burger!
You can add $3 to make it a set with fries and drinks. They have quite a few fries options, and honestly their normal fries is already very good. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, you can taste the fresh potato flavours still. Even when it's cold and soggy, it's still really good! That got me addicted! If you like some spice, do opt for the cajun fries as they can be quite spicy yet flavourful. The truffle mayo ($1.20) add on is really a must as its such an addictive sauce to with everything!
Thank you @eatwithkeat for inviting and thank you @ootbsg for hosting!",5
"During this rainy season, one dish I crave is fish head steamboat, and the one from this zi char stall really doesn't disappoint. Their cook is good, making other zi char dishes really good as well!
The Fish Head Steamboat ($35) came in a big pot with numerous vegetable ingredients and fish head slices. There may be quite some bones in each of the pieces, but they do have quite some meat as well. The fish head meat had a wonderful bite, with fresh sweet fish flavours coming in. Their soup is really the highlight, with rich robust flavours coming from the anchovies, vegetables and fish head. Its super addictive!
Their BBQ Sotong Squid ($36 for 3, seasonal price) is another of their speciality and I highly recommend getting them. Each squid slice is tender yet chewy and they were packed with so much seafood sweetness and smokiness from the grill. Pair them with their homemade green chilli sauce and it's really perfect.
Even their vegetable dish is worth a mention. Their Stir Fried Potato Leaves ($18 for medium) is fresh and all generously drenched in a robust sauce and the fried preserved vegetables on top made the dish so much more complex with its contrasting crispy texture and the smoky savoury flavours.
Definitely be back again!",5
"Was looking for some good lunch fare and we chanced upon this popular izakaya!
Ikki Izakaya offers a variety of lunch sets and I got the tempura set ($15.90) which came with a variety of dishes. The number of tempura pieces isn't many, but at least the ingredients were fresh and quite well fried. The tempura batter was light and does not feel too oily. I liked the salad and fruits given, as they were refreshing and helped to ease the oiliness of the tempura pieces.
A choice to consider if you work nearby. Definitely wished that they gave more tempura pieces though!",4
"Finally, I have found coffee that I am willing to travel for.
Hidden among the brightly lit shops around is this small coffee place and their Avocado Coffee ($6.50) is really so good!
It seems like they use real avocado and we loved how the creaminess of the avocado works so well with their aromatic coffee, intensifying the richness of their coffee. The coffee itself is really aromatic and smooth. Such a lovely cup of coffee and I dare say its one of the best cups I've had in Singapore in a long while.
Will try their other interesting coffee flavours next time!",5
"Hidden within Plaza Singapura's Kopitiam is this teochew noodles which were pretty satisfying!
I had the meatball noodles ($7.10 with addition of extra noodles) which came with quite a handful of meatballs in a meat broth, paired a bowl of springy noodles. The noodles had a chewy texture and were all generously coated in a savoury chilli sauce that has notes of vinegar and dried shrimp. There were quite a bit of pork lard oil too, which made the noodles even more delicious. Love the old school flavour of the noodles!
The meat broth was not bad and the meatballs were quite bouncy. This is definitely an option to consider if you are nearby!",4
"Finally here at iSteaks to try their beef steaks after hearing some good reviews!
I had the 350g Striploin ($30.50) which came with the right doneness of medium rare that I asked for. The steak had a good one inch thickness, sealing much of the meat juices within the steak. This may not be the juiciest steak nor a very flavourful one, but it was definitely affordable. Great to see that there is some good crust on the meat for the additional smokey flavour! Not bad of a steak.
I had 2 sides to go with the steak, garlic butter eggplant and good old French fries. Love the amount of garlic and the savoury butter which pairs well with the sweetness of the eggplant! The French fries were crispy and flavourful.
Although I wish for the steak to be juicier and more flavourful, its still a good place to satisfy your steak cravings without burning a large hole in your pocket!",4
"Found this new cafe located in the heart of Chinatown!
Boasting a pretty entrance and interior, the seating space within is really huge! Definitely a place I would consider to study or work in.
We ordered a hot Mocha ($6.80) and an Iced Espresso Matcha Fusion ($8). The Mocha had a very deep, bold and rich chocolate flavour which complemented the coffee well! Although abit too sweet towards the end, it was an enjoyable cup of coffee.
The Espresso Matcha Fusion was sadly not up to our liking. You can feel the clumps of Matcha powder within and the flavour was definitely not smooth. Sadly I have drank much better dirty matcha in other places �",3
"Went to Sura to try their lunch course and we felt that the presentation of the food was very appeasing and that the quality of food served were good, but may be abit too expensive for the ingredients served.
At $68 per pax, the lunch course consists of 7 different courses including 1 meat of your choice and we chose the beef and pork spare ribs. The beef ribs were juicy, quite moderately tender and has quite a bit of flavour. I love how the smoke from the charcoal is infused into the meat and pairing it with salt is really satisfying enough!
The pork ribs were even better. Juicy, smokey and very flavourful, they were marinated in a sweet savoury sauce which caramelised in the charcoal fire, intensifying the wonderful flavour of the meat.
We were served sashimi as well, but we felt like they didn't have much flavour although they were fresh.
The rest of the courses were mostly vegetables, which were fresh but we hoped to see more meat ingredients. Their previous lunch menu used to have more meat dishes.
Service was abit disappointing as well, as none of the dishes were explained to us and the condiments for the meats were adruptly taken away while we were still using.
All in all, the food quality and presentation was indeed good but based on the ingredients served, it may not be entirely worth the price.

"[INVITED TASTING] We tried a huge variety of meat dishes and soups from Gaga Roasted Delights in Rivervale Mall's food court and we were overall impressed!
The roasted duck meat at Gaga was moderately tender, well seasoned and I belive there was dang gui in the marinade used to flavour the meat. The roasted pork had a crispy skin with moderately tender meat. The char siew meat may be on the leaner side, but was good paired with the sweet and savoury sauce.
I believe the winner of all meats have to be their sausages, as although they may seem unassuming, they were packed with so much flavour! I'm a fan of smoky sausages and this definitely falls under my radar. The smoky flavour in this is so strong and is wonderful with the sweet savoury marinade within the sausage! Perfect with rice with the thick meat sauce provided.
All of their soups were not bad, but the one that left a huge impression got to be their Black Chicken Herbal Soup ($6). It came with a generous portion of black chicken and the herbal flavours in this is strong! Definitely one comforting soup to get on rainy days or with their meats to ease down the oiliness.
Their noodles ($1.2) is definitely worth a mention too. Springy wonton noodles all drenched in pork lard and soya sauce, the noodles had so much savoury flavours and was really addictive. I really can just eat the noodles without anything else!
Would recommend if you are around the area! Thank you @laoniangagency @amazingkway @eatwithkeat for inviting and @gagaroasteddelights for hosting!",4
"With all my friends raving about Omote to me, I finally made my way over to give it a try.
I ordered the Umami Soy Chirashi ($19.80) which may look like a small bowl, but is packed full of seafood ingredients under a bed of lovely well marinated rice. From salmon to tuna to octopus, all chopped sashimi were very quite thick, fresh and all drenched in the umami soya sauce. The sauce is very flavourful and is both sweet and savoury. To be honest, as much as the sauce was great, I wished I had ordered it without as the strong flavours might have overpowered the fresh seafood taste of the lovely ingredients. Nonetheless, it was still an extremely enjoyable bowl and I wiped it clean.
I also added on the premium set ($8.80) which came with a plethora of dishes from chawamushi to salmon sashimi to various appetisers. All were well executed, and I was really spoilt for choice on what my next bite should be.
Another worthy mention really got to be their soya sauce on the table. It is thicker than the usual ones, and I love how the umami from the sauce is intensified but yet less salty compared to the commercial ones. Pairing this with their classic Chirashi Don would be the perfect meal.
Absolutely lovely meal. A good place to treat yourself!",5
"Among the numerous cafe places at Upper thomson, Oaks Coffee appealed to us due to its aesthetic yet cozy interior. We got a creamy white ($7) and an Iced Mocha ($6). The creamy white was indeed creamy, but the coffee wasn't very strong. If you like your coffee stronger, this may not be the coffee for you. The Iced Mocha was good! Rich and creamy with the coffee and chocolate notes complementing each other well. Definitely can taste that they used a good chocolate syrup.
A good cafe to chill and hide away from the afternoon heat!",4
"Had a great time at TAP after work especially after a long day! TAP Craft Beer Bar is known for their extensive selection of craft beers and indeed I was spolit for choice. They allow you to taste the beers before choosing and I settled upon Jing A Ale ($14 for jumbo glass).
The taste profile of Jing-A Ale is of a light one, definitely not hoppy like the pale ales and very refreshing. There is a hint of mandarin citrus, which really brightens up the aftertaste of the beer. Definitely a good choice even for non beer drinkers!
We realised that there was a 1 for 1 Bites promotion, and we got a variety. One of the top hits were definitely the curly fries ($11) which were fried to perfection. Savoury with good seasoning, the fries were very morish and the generous portion soon disappeared.
Another mention would be the popcorn chicken ($18), which although seemed pretty pricey, it came in a generous portion and they were not too hard. The meat within was still quite substantial and juicy. Perfect bar food!
Located right smack in the CBD area, its a good place to come down to wind down after a hard day's work!",4
"Although we ordered way too much, the quality and portions made us so satisfied!
The Dakgalbi sharing portion came in a huge plate, probably enough to feed at least 3. There were loads of ingredients within, from tender chicken pieces, to chewy rice cakes to fresh assorted vegetables. Loved how the sauce has a good balance of sweet and savoury, definitely perfect to go with some rice.
We ordered bossam as well, and it was surprisingly good! The pieces of pork were very fatty and tender. Paired with ssam and some savoury radish slices, its really the perfect balance of fresh and fatty taste profiles.
The jajjangmyeon or black bean noodles came in an enormous plate as well, enough to feed at least 3. Although the noodles didn't have the chewy noodles I was looking for, the sauce had good flavour and was filled with seafood ingredients including squid and prawns.
Although we over ordered and had 2 bottles of makgeoli, the price came up to $42 per pax which isn't bad at all. Definitely worth it and a place to check out if you are nearby and craving for Korean food!",5
"Now I really believe this is how all hor fun should be. I've had this before but my recent experience was even better!
What makes this Beef Hor Fun ($6) stand out is the enormous amount of wok hei flavour in their noodles. The wok hei flavour adds so much flavour to the dish and it actually has a bitter aftertaste that I still appreciated. The noodles were all drenched in thick garlicky savoury sauce and it was so good I slurped them all up! The beef slices were really tender too. The portion was great and this was such a satisfying meal!",5
"Located in a quiet corner of Tanjong Pagar, Urban Corner serves up no frills western food. The burpple beyond set comes with a chicken main with bratwurst, a fish main with prawn aglio olio, and 2 bowls of mushroom soup all for $22. The portions were huge and if you are looking for some no-frills western food, this is one place to consider.
The Chicken chop itself was tender and not overly salted. Bratwurst was juicy and tasted pretty standard. Fries were creamy on the inside and crispy outside.
The Fish Fillet itself was quite meaty and perhaps the only problem was that the batter was abit too hard. Prawn aglio olio was pretty standard and not bad.
Service was attentive. Definitely above than average food and is quite worth it with the burpple beyond set!",4
"Was pleased by the service from this neighbourhood cafe and was even more impressed by their gelato!
We had their waffles with 3 scoops of ice cream ($16.60) and we got the Earl Grey Tie Guan Yin, Black Sesame/Goma and Speculoos.
The Earl Grey Tie Guan Yin was the best among all, with the floral Earl Grey flavour complementing so well with the fragrance of the Tie Guan Yin tea. Not too sweet and a delightful flavour, this is one ice cream to get here.
The Black Sesame or Goma was also very impressive, with a good mixture within with milk flavoured ice cream so that the black sesame does not come out too strong. It is not too grainy as well and the richness of the sesame flavour was just right.
The Speculoos flavour was good, not too sweet and you get the caramel flavour you would expect.
The waffles were fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy outside. Definitely a good pairing for the delicious ice cream!",4
"We also got quite a variety of satay ($0.80 each) and chicken wings ($1.40 each) from ABC Satay Chicken Wings and most were good! The chicken wings had a good savoury sweet marinade and were very tender and succulent. Though the mutton satay were tough, the chicken ones were tender and all were smoky. A good sharing dish!",4
"The Oyster Omelette ($6 for larger portion) from Tanglin were delightful too! The egg omelette is more starchy than crispy, which is actually the kind I prefer due to the more silky smooth texture. Oyster were plump and really juicy; many of them were bursting with juices in my mouth! Pair them with their garlicky spicy chilli and gets even better.",4
"Finally tried Satay Bee Hoon ($5 for larger portion) from Soon Huat and I can see why people love this! The sauce rich but not cloying, and has a good savoury sweet peanut flavour. We actually prefer the satay sauce with yellow noodles instead, as the richer taste of the yellow noodles complemented so well with the thick sauce! It's similar to mee rebus! There were quite a few ingredients too, especially some cuttlefish and fresh cockles.",4
"Among the few fish soup stalls in Ghim Moh, I believe this shines about the rest. With quite a robust fish broth that is also flavoured by the fried egg bits, Hong Sheng Fish Soup's double fish soup ($6) definitely is a comforting meal. Though the fried fish slices were really thick, I wished that the sliced fish slices given were a little bigger. All fish slices were fresh nonetheless! Get their chili sauce mixed with fermented bean sauce for extra spicy umami kick!

"A relatively new addition to Redhill Food Centre, I was intrigued by the long lines at this hor fun stall.
True enough, this plate of Beef Hor Fun ($5.50) was satisfying. The noodles were silky smooth and had a moderate amount of wok hei, not too much and not too little. Definitely lived up to their name! The sauce was savoury, with a good amount of garlic within. Beef slices were quite tender, except the parts I got with some tendon within.
This plate definitely got me continuously slurping up the noodles, and I can't wait to try their seafood white bee boon next time!
Wok Hei Hor Fun",4
"Was surprised to see such a dark coloured fish soup and this is really packed with flavour!
I got the double fish soup ($5.50) with ee mian and it came with quite a few pieces of fried and fresh fish slices. The soup itself is robust and you can taste the fish flavour extracted from boiling the bones for some time. It is also heavily flavoured with the fried egg added, giving this soup an extra savoury flavour.
The fresh fish slices were very fresh and bouncy, and I loved them with the dipping sauce made from fermented soy beans! Fried fish slices were pretty huge and meaty too. Absolutely lovely if you like your fish soup quite heavy tasting!

"Why didn't I know about this burger bar earlier? This was the thought I had when I left the restaurant with both my heart and stomach full.
The Raclette Burger with Beef Patty ($26) was one beautifully juicy burger, with a wonderfully thick slab of Raclette cheese. Biting into this brings out a myriad of flavours coming from the juicy beef patty, savoury cheese and most importantly, the recommended cream pepper sauce. The cream pepper sauce was rich and I loved the amazing aroma that comes from the black pepper after. This is one bloody good burger.
The Monsieur Burger with Crispy Chicken Patty ($24) was really good as well! The thick chicken patty had a good crispy batter and juicy flavourful meat within. This is paired well with the crispy hashbrown and flavourful BBQ sauce. Lovely flavours coming from this as well.
All their burgers come with handmade fries, which were really addictive as they were well seasoned and surprisingly creamy inside! Portions of fries were so huge we couldn't finish!
Definitely will be back. I would rate this as one of the best burgers I've had really!",5
"Finally tried this literal hole in the wall cafe, but somehow the coffee was quite sour.
We got the Iced Dark Mocha ($8 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and although the chocolate used was rich, the coffee was quite sour. You can taste alot of citrus notes with tangy aftertaste. Not sure if it's because of a bad brew or bad beans, but we wished the coffee isn't this sour.
Perhaps maybe it's just this instance!",3
"Back at one of my favourite restaurants for affordable grilled meats and their high quality still remains the same!
Their Lamb Rack ($36 for half slab) is really one of the must get here. The lamb racks came smoky, with a wonderful aroma of roasted meat. Slicing through each piece is an easy task, as they were really juicy and tender. Flavours are wonderful as well, as it was well seasoned with salt and pepper, and the gaminess of the lamb isn't strong or not there at all.
The Australian Grass Fed Ribeye ($29 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is pretty delicious too, as it came with a good thickness and with good flavours too. Beautifully seasoned, pretty tender and definitely meaty.
Iberico Spare Ribs ($29 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) were tender, succulent and smoky. Loved the marinade on top as well!
They not only do well with their meats, their sides were well executed too. The wedges on the side were crispy on the outside and very much creamy within. Really addictive!",5
"Back at one of my favourite cafes once again and had my favourite dishes once again!
The Braised Beef Cheeks ($28 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is what I would describe a comforting dish, as it comes executed well with my 2 favourite ingredients, potato and beef. The mashed potato is beautifully creamy and buttery, and it's perfect with the tender flavourful beef slices and the umami tasting mushroom slices. A must order here I would say!
Prawn Basil Pesto Pasta ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was another good dish to order, as the al dente pasta were well coated with a garlicky and aromatic pesto sauce. Prawns were well bouncy too. Lovely flavours coming from this dish definitely!
Definitely back another day �",4
"A new establishment, Soon Huat Bak Kut Teh is one of the newest addition to the few food options around in the area. I was very pleasantly surprised to find Malaysian style bak kut teh here!
We tried a couple of dishes they have here:
Bak Kut Teh ($8) - we believe the soup is really the highlight here; it had pleasant herbal flavours coupled with a savoury meat broth that really makes you addicted to the soup! Love that it isn't too peppery too. The meat pieces were quite meaty and tender.
Sesame Oil Chicken ($10) - loved the savoury sauce which paired well with rice. They gave quite a few chicken pieces and they were flavourful and tender as well! However, we do think they can go heavier on the sesame oil.
Pig Stomach Soup ($8.50) - the soup is definitely more light tasting, but still has good umami flavours coming from the pork broth within. Not sure what they added in to make it white, but it definitely made the soup almost creamy! Pig stomach pieces were fresh.
Definitely will be back when I'm around the area!

"A very quaint cafe hidden within the neighbourhood, Rise offers a huge variety of cakes, gelato and coffee.
We had the Iced Latte ($5.50) and Iced Mocha ($6) for our drinks and we were so pleased with the coffee! The Iced Latte was smooth and fragrant without being too milky. The Iced Mocha was the star of the show really, as it had such a strong dark chocolatey flavour without overpowering the aromatic coffee notes and without being too sweet. Absolutely lovely.
We had a Passionfruit Lemon Teacake ($7.20) to share, and it was soft, fluffy and not too sweet.
Definitely a good place to chill and have good conversations!",4
"Finally tried Granny's all famous peanut butter pancake ($1.40) at the Hong Lim Food Centre and I was so satisfied!
You will notice that the pancake given to you is really hot to the touch, as it is made fresh. They were really generous with the crushed peanuts and peanut butter, and I loved how rich and nutty each bite was. This may be one sinful pancake, but definitely worth the calories �
Was really hard to resist getting another piece!",4
"Had lunch in this cafe/bar near my workplace, and was really satisfied with the food!
The Melba breakfast ($27) had a variety of ingredients and they were all cooked very well and I loved their bacon especially, as it had a good sear without being too hard. Definitely a very filling portion as well!
Tried my friend's beef stew (part of $25 lunch set) and the beef were so flavourful and tender! Lovely pieces to go with the creamy mash under.
A big place to have conversations with your colleagues and friends. Definitely recommended!",4
"[INVITED TASTING] Tee Ruk Mookata serves up fresh ingredients with unique items such as Moo Sab, which is marinated minced pork with egg yolk, for you to have a joyous mookata bbq.
We had a variety of ingredients, from seafood like fresh prawns to meat ingredients like sliced pork and beef. Their $68.80 set consists of a variety of meat and vegetable ingredients and can feed perhaps 4 small eaters or 3 medium eaters.
We tried a few ingredients that were not part of the set too, and I particularly loved the Moo Sab ($8.90) as it was like a tasty meat pancake after grilling. Great add on to try with friends!
Most marinated meats were tender but we wished that the marination of meat can be heavier for a stronger flavour.
Not bad of a mookata bbq, can visit if you are around the area!
Thank you @teerukmookata for hosting and @laoniangagency @amazingkway @eatwithkeat for inviting!",4
"Wonder if you all get handmade noodle or ban mian cravings sometimes like me! I was craving some handmade noodles soup today and noticed that there was a longer line for this stall compared to the others in Redhill Food Centre.
I had the Mee Hoon Kway Soup ($4.50) and it came with a couple of ingredients like minced pork and sliced pork. The soup itself is definitely comforting, with flavours coming from what I believe an anchovy stock base. The egg is beaten within the soup, making it extra smooth. The noodles are slightly chewy but I wished that they add abit more salt in the dough itself as it can be abit plain on its own.
Their chilli is worth noticing too! With the right amount of salt and vinegar, the chilli was tangy, savoury and spicy altogether.
Will try the other handmade noodle stalls around too!
He Jia Huan Handmade Noodles",4
"SYIP recently opened a new outlet and this outlet boasts a much bigger space!
We had the Truffle Cheese Sandwich ($19) and the Mentaiko Shrimp Burger ($20) and we were very satisfied with the mains! The cheese sandwich had really strong truffle flavour which went so well with the savoury melty cheese within. Dip them in the tomato soup given and you get a wonderful breakfast meal.
The Mentaiko Shrimp Burger patty reminded me of fried shrimp rolls you get from chinese restaurants. Loved the buttered brioche buns and the thick layer of mentaiko sauce too!
As for drinks we had Iced Mocha ($7) and SYIP White Coffee ($7). The Mocha had good chocolate flavours, with aromatic coffee notes. Not grainy at all, the chocolate used was definitely of good quality! The white coffee had a thick layer of cream on top which made the aromatic coffee even richer.
Definitely will be back to try more dishes and coffee!",5
"Ordered a takeaway from the newest Tampines East outlet. Loved how the Sweet Spicy Fried Chicken or Yangnyeom ($27 for 14 pcs) was not only covered with loads of sweet, savoury and spicy sauce, the crust of the chicken was still crispy. The chicken itself may be dry at certain parts, but overall mostly were tender and succulent.
I remember not liking the soy flavour at the Bedok outlet, but the Soy Flavour ($27 for 14 pcs) from this outlet was much better. Although the soy sauce isn't the usual kind, the flavour is still good in this outlet. The sauce is on a sweeter side and the chicken can be abit dry. Still a good fried chicken for its price though!
Definitely an affordable Korean fried chicken to have whenever I have such cravings �",4
"Hidden away in a private estate neighbourhood, this cafe boasts large spaces and a cozy environment to just chill or get some work done.
We had an Iced cappuccino ($6.50) and an Iced Rose Mocha ($7.50). The cappuccino had good aromatic flavour without being too milky, and the rose mocha may be sweet, but the taste of rose definitely made the drink more aromatic.
A nice place to come!",4
"Finally found a chance to try out their value for money dons!
We had the Chirashi 6 kinds Don ($12) which was honestly really cheap for the amount given. Each piece of sashimi were thick and really fresh. The best among all got to be their salmon sashimi, as they were so succulent and sweet! The rice was fluffy and was flavoured perfectly. The roasted duck was an interesting addition which was still appreciated, as they were tender and smoky.
The Salmon Mentai Don ($10) had quite a good amount of salmon pieces all covered with a generous amount of mentaiko sauce. The sauce boast heavy and rich mentaiko flavour, which was perfect with the rice below.
We had salmon sashimi to share ($8) and the plate had 6 thick pieces!
Really a lovely shop within a kopitiam, but sadly they will be leaving the current premises. However, they will update their next location on Facebook �",5
"If you would like some quality Japanese fare, this is one place to go. Although it may be located in a very unknown area, this place has a poolside view for you to enjoy with your food!
I had a Chirashi Don ($19.80) while my friends had the Truffle Wagyu Don with Foie Gras ($35.80) and we got the premium sides (for additional $8) that has miso soup, chaiwanmushi, salmon sashimi and mochi.
The Chirashi Don itself boast quite a few ingredients from scallops to chutoro. Every piece of sashimi is really fresh and they were perfect with the freshly grated wasabi and soy sauce. To me I feel like the quality of the rice really makes or breaks a don, and I'm glad to say that the rice in this don is really something. It's not only fluffy, it's very well flavoured with the right amount of mirin. Absolutely beautiful.
I tried abit of the truffle wagyu don and I loved how crispy and smoky the beef slices were! The beef slices were tender as well and the truffle taste is noticeable. The foie gras pieces were very rich and fatty, perfect with the bed of rice below.
Definitely a good place to come for date nights �",5
"Sad to hear that Glacier will be closing this coming End Jan 2023 and decided to make a trip down for their mochi waffles once again.
Their mochi waffles once again doesn't disappoint, with their good chewy texture and a crispy exterior. The pandan taste is quite prominent, which makes it fragrant as well.
As for their ice cream we got the espresso biscoff and the pulau hitam. The espresso biscoff has a good coffee fragrance and some caramelised notes after. Pulau hitam taste exactly like how it should be, just milker. We had their Uji Houjicha as well which the roasted tea taste was strong albeit abit too sweet.
Will miss you mochi waffles!�",5
"Finally came here after seeing all the hype about it. We tried a few dishes:
CCB Bun ($7.50) - using the Chinese soft buns as a base, this came with a pretty massive fried chicken cutlet with a spicy slaw. The chicken itself may not be very crispy, but it was definitely tender and flavourful. The slaw helps to cut the oiliness of the chicken so that you won't get tired of it easily.
Niu Yue Fried Rice ($20) - fried rice was just average, and the beef slices were just way too thin. Truffle flavours were subtle. We felt like this isn't really worth it.
Balsamic Vinegar Fries ($10) - crispy fluffy fries were addictive! Love the balsamic vinegar sauce around the fries as it has a moderate tartiness that makes keep going for them without being tired! Great dish to share.
Overall we felt like the dishes really don't deserve a long wait, as we heard that some even queue 1 hour for this. Perhaps a place to try once.",3
"Feel like it's quite rare to find herbal bak kut teh and I'm glad to have found this chain!
Their weekday lunch set ($10.90) consists of a regular bak kut teh, 2 sides and a drink. Do note that rice is not included, but you can choose it as 1 of your side dish.
The soup itself is not bad, it has the herbal flavours and it is not too salty. The meats given were moderately tender and best paired with soya sauce and chilli! I'm surprised to find some pork liver and stomach as well, which were fresh.
Not bad of an option if you are around the area!",4
"[INVITED TASTING] Douraku Sushi is a Japanese food restaurant under the Tung Lok Group and it is interesting to eat Japanese food in a Chinese banquet setting. We had a quite a few of their dishes and here are some of my favourites:
Premium Sashimi Platter ($168): Now this is really the highlight of our meal. The platter consists of many different seafood ingredients, including exquite ones like uni and botan ebi. All seafood items were so fresh and really good on their own! I especially loved the tuna slices, as they were so thick and succulent.
Pitan Tofu ($10): The century egg cream is somehow both sweet and savoury and they do go very well with the plain tofu within!
Braised Tuna Cheek (~$40): this is a seasonal item and it is quite enjoyable due to the high fat content within the tuna meat. As this piece was really meaty, it is possible to share among 6-8 people. Definitely best paired with rice and their braising sauce!
We had some seasonal tuna eyeballs as well � definitely not for the faint hearted, but I can see people who are used to the gelatinous texture loving this dish.
Thank you @burpple for inviting and @dourakusushi for hosting!",4
"Surprised to see a restaurant within Bee Cheng Hiang, and the food is not bad!
The Fish & Chips ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) came with a rather huge fish fillet that is surprisingly meaty. The batter is crispy and isn't too salty and the seemingly homemade tartar sauce complements it well. Fries were crispy, but they seem quite greasy. Perhaps they could have allowed the oil to drip away more!
The DIY sliders ($16 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) were not bad but sadly they came in really small portions. Perhaps this is perfect for small eaters. Love how bak kwa is substituted in as meat patties, as the meat flavours were intense!
Although the Mozzarella Katsu ($12) came rather small, they were packed with cheese and bak kwa and we loved how they complemented each other so well to produce rich, smoky and meaty flavours.
Shall be back actually to taste other interesting bak kwa dishes!",4
"Live Seafood Market is quite a new establishment by The Three Peacocks, a popular seafood bbq restaurant, and we were quite impressed with their food quality and selections! We went there for lunch and it was just $33.80++ per person.
There were quite a few favourites among the plethora of food options, especially the grilled food, sashimi and sushi items! The grilled chicken was really smokey, tender and flavourful. Their yakitori sticks were so succulent, tender and very well marinated that I had to get many more of them. Their Mentaiko Tamagoyaki is a must try too, as the mentaiko sauce has such a strong flavour as they definitely put in alot of the mentaiko�
As for their sashimi, they were in relatively thick slices and they were fresh � Love their nigiri sushi options too, especially the salmon sushi as the fish to rice ratio is just nice, and the flavoured rice was really tasty.
There were just too many food items that we like to mention, but in conclusion, we felt like it was really value for money for the quality. Great for family celebrations!",4
"The burger may seem oddly shaped but hey, it was pretty fantastic.
We got the Three Cheese Beef Burger ($24.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Australian Wild Caught Snapper Burger ($25.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and they were both delicious!
The beef patty in the three cheese burger was thick, had a nice pinky middle and was definitely very flavourful. The beef flavours in this were good and it was very nicely seasoned. The cheese was strong and savoury. Wish it was juicer though!
The Snapper patty was interesting, as it had a flavourful fresh fish flavour together with a pretty strong citrus taste. The fish within is definitely seasoned well.
We loved how both buns were very nicely grilled, with a crusty exterior and a fluffy inside. The butter within is strong and you can taste how fragrant the butter is! Both came with caramelised onions and they gave the burger a nice touch of sweetness. Fries were addictive too!
Both were good burgers and we gobbled them all!",5
"Ordered a huge variety of dishes and skewers and boy were our bellies satisfied! Here's a couple of my favourites:
Deep Fried Spicy Diced Chicken ($19) - now this is an addictive dish. Though many of the diced chicken may not have much meat, they were really crispy, nicely flavoured by the spices used and not too spicy. The leeks and peanuts within were nice ingredients to binge on too!
Chili Soup ($6) - this came in a big bowl and can be divided into 5 bowls. Loved the spicy sour flavours coming from this soup and its especially good with extra vinegar!
Lamb Kebab ($1.50 per skewer) - the meat was quite tender and the mutton odour was quite subtle! The cumin and chilli flavours were strong and its perfect with beer!
Grilled Small Mantou ($2 per skewer) - this is more like a dessert, as the mantou are coated with sugar. Sweet yet smoky from the grill, this is really delicious especially when the other food items were savoury!
Definitely a wonderful place to gather with your friends, but the ambience may be too noisy for some!",4
"I must say, I haven't had great fish soup in some time and I'm glad to have chanced upon this stall.
I had the Yuan Yang Bee Hoon Soup ($6.50 for medium) and it came with a pretty generous number of fresh and fried fish slices. The fish slices were all fresh and flavourful, and it's best paired with their sambal belacan!The sauce definitely has a kick and has full of umami �
The soup itself is incredibly robust, with umami from fish stock coming strong and the milk added made it even richer! Very addictive.
I love how a fried egg is added as well to give the soup more flavour. This is definitely a comforting dish to have on a rainy day!",5
"Chanced upon a very unassuming fishball noodles stall and was rather impressed with their bowl of noodles!
I got their Signature Teochew Noodles ($5.50 for large) and I must say it came pretty generous with ingredients. From 2 rather large prawns to fish dumplings to huge chunks of braised mushrooms, there were many to savour! The noodles were soaked in quite abit of vinegar with pretty spicy chilli, and I fell in love with the old school taste that I very much remembered when I was young! I wouldn't say this is one of the best bowl of noodles, but definitely better than average.
This is one bowl to check out if you are in the area!
Lao Cai Shi Fishball Noodles",4
"[INVITED TASTING] Had a chance to try out the different desserts Butter Studio had to offer and here are some mentions:
Sea Salt Nutella Tart ($6.90): If you love your nutella, this is one to try. The nutella filling is so rich with the hazelnut chocolate flavours and what that impressed me was the tart pastry itself, as it was not too hard nor crumbly. Glad that it wasn't soft or soggy too! Definitely a fresh tart.
Summer Lemon with Coconut Meringue Tart ($7.90): not too sweet and yet refreshing, I love the citrus flavours coming through this one. The coconut flavours are subtle and not overpowering, complementing the lemon flavours well!
Red Velvet Cupcake ($3.90): really can't go wrong with this one, as its their all time signature. Soft cake with good cream cheese frosting. May get abit sweet towards the end!
Pistachio Gelato ($6): Glad that it's smooth and not grainy at all, with the nutty flavours of the pistachio coming in moderately strong. This is a creamier version but I believe the pistachio flavour can be stronger!
Thank you for the invite @burpple and thank you @butterstudio for hosting!",4
"Trying out another hotpot brand, and this was not bad!
We had a variety of soup bases, with the better ones being the collagen pork bone broth and the simmered chicken soup with herbs. The pork broth was rich, savoury and quite creamy, and the herbal chicken soup had a strong chicken flavour with pretty aromatic flavour coming from the herbs. Each soup cost under $4, which we felt was quite affordable too.
The seafood platter ($16.90 for half portion) came with a variety of seafood ingredients that range from scallops to prawns to clams. The ingredients were all quite fresh and we especially enjoyed the scallops, which had such a sweet umami flavour.
The Prawn Paste ($7.40 for half portion) was very flavourful too and we loved the texture as it seemed like it was almost entirely made from prawn meat!
For carbs, one should really go for their handmade noodle ($2.80 for full portion) which had such a great mouth feel due to its springy texture and it really soaks up the flavour of the broth you put into!
Total bill was about $80 for 2 which isn't too bad. They do have value sets that are at most $20 too that you can consider if you are on a budget!",4
"Was craving for some minced meat noodles, and I am glad that this bowl from Liang Chuan Fishball Minced Meat Noodles did its job. I got their middle sized portion for $4.50 and it came with quite a handful of ingredients and noodles. The noodles were springy and were well coated with their signature chilli sauce.
Their chilli sauce is definitely their highlight, due to its strong umami flavours coming from grinded shrimps. The chilli has a good heat as well and was not too spicy. So darn addictive!
The meatballs and minced meat were all pretty tender too. Definitely a bowl to satisfy my BCM cravings!",4
"Surprised to find yam coffee ($3) in an eatery but I must say this was really pretty good!
The coffee itself is of a strong traditional brew, not too bitter and quite smooth! It is sweetened by the yam syrup below, which adds an earthy flavour that does complement well with the coffee. Quite a unique flavour, but I actually would get this again!
If you love yam and coffee, why not!",4
"Finally tried this really famous pasta place and well there were hits and misses.
Radiatori with Cheese and Alfredo Sauce ($12.40) - we had fun making our own pasta creations and this turned out pretty well! The pasta had a huge number of ridges to catch the creamy sauce and cheese and it was rich and flavourful. However, I do find the pasta cooked abit too soft and they seasoned the dish with too much salt.
Gemelli with Prawn and Pesto ($17.30) - the pesto sauce was very delightful, with a good amount of creaminess and basil flavours coming through. Prawns were fresh and the noodles were al dente. However, this was abit too salty as well.
Calamari ($19.90) - honestly way too expensive. The squid rings were okay, nothing much to shout about.
Overall, it's definitely a place for more than average quality pastas but I wouldn't say one of the best. The ambience is really good for date nights though!",3
"Chanced upon this durian cafe and oh my this is one place every durian lover should go.
We got the Durian Sago ($8.50) which seems to be one of the signatures here. The desserts here are made with MSW durians and I definitely can taste the high quality durians used in this dessert. The mousse itself is thick, very rich and very fragrant, with strong decadent durians flavours. To accompany the mousse, you have abit of shaved ice that helps to keep the dessert cold and coconut nata de coco which was a complementary addition. You also have the scoop of what I thought was durian ice cream, but it's actually frozen MSW durian meat. Having the meat together with the mousse intensifies the durian flavours, but gives a more bittersweet flavour which we loved.
The Durian Roll ($8) was soft and isn't that rich, but overall a good Swiss roll. Definitely generous with the durian cream within the roll.
The durian sago is what I am willing to travel from the east for, when I'm craving durian desserts�",5
"Finally tried this western food stall in a pretty secluded area and it was really pretty good!
The Black Pepper Chicken Chop ($7.80) came in a pretty sizeable portion, with a huge amount of sauce given. The chicken was grilled well and was tender. The black pepper sauce was definitely savoury and very peppery, great for people who love the pepper flavour! Side were okay, nothing much to shout out about. This is like your old school western fare but definitely a better quality!
The Fish And Chips ($8.80) came with 2 pieces of fried fillet, which were fried well. The batter was light and crispy, while keeping the fish moist within. The fish was fresh and flaky! Paired with their tartar sauce, this is one good old school western fare.
Saw that there is stall selling cheap beers on tap, definitely getting those next time to accompany the food here �",4
"Every time I crave for durian desserts, this is one of my go-to places. Their Durian Mousse ($9.80 with double portion of D24 durian flesh) is very satisfying with cold durian cream that is thick and refreshing and durian flesh that is fresh and aromatic. It was so good we had to get 2 bowls to share!
We got their Mango Pomelo Sago ($4) as well, which was creamy and came with huge chunks of mango pieces that were adequately sweet. A standard Chinese dessert to order!
Definitely one dessert place to check out, especially when they open till late.",5
"Hidden in a neighbourhood in Boon Keng lies this pretty chill looking cafe which we happened to chance upon as we wanted coffee.
I must say our expectations came tumbling down as the service isn't friendly as we ordered our coffee. Our opinions definitely changed when we tried their coffee.
Their Iced Brown ($6) or Iced Mocha was incredibly smooth, with the strong coffee complementary their chocolate sauce very well. Both their coffee and chocolate were definitely of good quality and we were surprised how the coffee isn't dry or sour at the end! A very good brew, perhaps the best I've had yet.
Their Yuan Yang Affrogato ($6.80) consist of their Earl Grey Gelato with an espresso shot. Those 2 flavours definitely complemented really well, as the smooth aromatic coffee notes were augmented with some floral notes coming from the Earl Grey. So glad they managed to make the Earl Grey flavour strong and yet not too perfume like!
Definitely one of my top coffee places, as I can see that they do put a huge emphasis on their coffee. Perhaps maybe their service can be a little better, to make the whole experience a completely wonderful one �",4
"Have been seeing snaking queues at this fish soup restaurant for the longest time and glad that I finally tried!
The Red Snapper Fish Meat Steamboat ($60 for medium) came with several fish meat pieces and vegetable ingredients all heated using charcoal in the middle. The soup, being their signature, really did not disappoint as I was so surprised by the flavour of the broth. It is very robust and had alot of umami. You know they probably cooked fish bones in this for a very long time. The red snapper meat were meaty, though slightly mushy. Don't think this is the kind of fish we truly liked, though I didn't mind. Felt like though this may be a very good fish broth, its really expensive for the amount of fish meat given!
We also had to get their Prawn Paste Chicken ($15.80) which was fragrant and crispy, with pretty succulent meat. Definitely better than average.
Perhaps the magic question is if its worth the queue: I believe you can get good steamboat as well without the 30 min wait, but if the queue is shorter, this is something you can try!",4
"If you are a fish lover and don't mind picking out some bones, this will be a grilled fish from heaven for you. The full Grilled Striped Hokke Set Meal ($18.80) came with a really generous portion of grilled fish, which was so incredibly smoky and fatty. Although there may be some bones here and there, this is one meaty fish worthy picking out the bones for. Though I believe they can go easier on the salt as it was too salty, you can still taste the sweetness and freshness of the fish, coupled with the juicy rich flavours that the meat releases as they melt in your mouth. I think 1 whole fish may be too fatty for 1 person to finish, so perhaps you can order the half portion one at a cheaper price � This is one fish I will crave and will travel for. Will ask them to put less salt next time!

Don Don Donki @ The Central Clarke Quay",5
"We happened to past by Don Don Donki's food court in Clarke Quay and we knew we had to get this one day.
The original mazesoba ($13, we added $1.50 for egg) came with a huge amount of different ingredients, which all blended well together after stirring everything in. Indeed flavours in this is quite complex, with umami coming from the meat sauce and the sharp flavours from the spring onions. The al dente noodles did well to catch all the sauces and ingredients!
The white vinegar is to be added halfway through the meal, when the noodles may start to get surfeiting. The added sourness reminds me of extra black vinegar on my bak chor mee, which is really welcoming!
To end off, don't forget to ask the chef for a small portion of rice to mop up all the delicious sauce � Definitely a place to consider when you're here in Clarke Quay!",4
"I know many rave about their grilled chicken and breaded chicken mains together with their delicious sides, their Garlic Butter Mussels (~$7.50) are really to die for as well. I'm so glad I got this too when I ordered takeaway, as it came it generous portions and was absolutely delicious! Each fresh sweet mussels were well drenched in the garlic butter sauce, which has strong umami flavours coming from the garlic, and had a good rich creaminess that is addictive. Pair this sauce with their mushroom rice and it's a definite party in the mouth. Definitely giving this a must try rating!",5
"Hidden within a neighbourhood lies a homely ice cream cafe, with quality waffles and ice cream we loved!
Flavours of ice cream we got were:
Yakult Grape: very refreshing, each mouthful comes with a punch of grape flavour and a sour yogurt like aftertaste. Best for a hot afternoon!
Peanut Butter Oreo: this rendition isn't grainy at all, and I loved the deep peanut flavour that hits you straight and chocolatey oreo bits that comes after as you bite them.
Brownie: this is my personal favourite, as the chocolate flavours are really rich and strong. Very incredibly smooth and decadent.
Black Sesame: milky and slightly earthy, we felt like the black sesame taste isn't strong. Sadly this was our least favourite.
The waffles were really delightful, as they were crispy and airy, with a slight fluffiness within. Definitely a good non heavy waffle to have after a filling meal! Each double scoop waffle is $12.50.",4
"Finally sank my teeth into their all famous salted egg pork ribs ($14 for small portion) and I can definitely see why people rave over their rendition of this signature zi char dish.
The pork ribs were coated with a very generous amount of incredibly rich and creamy salted egg yolk sauce. The sauce even had chunks of salted egg yolk within, adding extra punch of flavour. The pork ribs themselves were moderately tender and still somewhat retains its outer crispness. Indeed extremely satisfying, but best shared with people to reduce its ""gelat"" effect.
The Salted Fish Fried Rice ($6 for small) came pretty generous as well and really has the smokey flavour. Although it can be a little too salty, it is still great to share around �
Definitely coming back when I'm craving salted egg pork ribs!",5
"[INVITED TASTING - PROMO BELOW] Had a fantastic time with Chef Terence in his new establishment @therestaurantmia, and we were so pleased with the food and here are some of my favourites:
Sticky Date Pudding (pictured behind) ($14) - now we have come to the desserts, and this really hits the spot. Imagine soft cake paired with a rich vanilla ice cream and salted caramel sauce, its a wonderful combination! The salted caramel was really rich and flavourful and I really love the crunch coming from their homemade crumble! Wonderful dish to end the night �

"With Simple Cafe moving closer to the east where I stay, we had to give it a try.
We ordered 2 coffees and 2 different bakes. The Spring Onion Amann ($7) is a very interesting take of the usual kouign amann, as it is a savoury pastry. The outer crust is beautifully crispy, and you get a good bold flavour from the spring onion slices within. The egg on top is a beautiful addition, as it adds another dimension to the pastry.
The Vanilla Donut ($4.5) was really soft and fluffy and nicely coated with sugar to give it an additional satisfying crunch. The vanilla custard is not too sweet and has a good vanilla taste!
Now to their coffee. Their mocha ($6.50) is okay though I feel like their chocolate syrup is a little lumpy.
We swapped out the hazelnut espresso you see in the picture for hazelnut latte ($7) that is not in the menu, and wow this is probably the best hazelnut latte I've had. The syrup they put in definitely isn't artificial and has very fragrant nutty flavour. Pity it came in a small cup!",4
"Saw this really popular Chinese dessert stall and really couldn't resist their chendol!
Their chendol ($3.2) is drenched in a lot of coconut milk and a really thick gula melaka syrup, which makes it so satisfying and addictive. It's not too sweet and has the savoury touch, making it not surfeiting. They were generous with the beans and pandan jelly as well.
We tried their other desserts as well and they were good but not too impressionable. If I'm around the area I might probably come here for their desserts, especially the chendol!",4
"Heard about this Korean bbq restaurant where Koreans go to have their bbq cravings and sure enough it's authentic and really good!
We had the dual pork set ($59) which comes with a thick pork belly and marinated pork neck. The pork belly slices were indeed cooked very well, with a beautiful crust and tender juicy meat within. The gamey pork taste isn't very strong as well! The marinated pork neck is surprisingly very tender, with a sweet and savoury marinade.
We added a portion of seasoned King size beef ribs ($41.90) and had no regrets as the beef was so tender and flavourful! Perfect with salt and pepper given on the side.
The set comes with steamed egg, a stew and a variety of side dishes. I must say I really love their kimchi, as it isn't too sour and spicy�",4
"This seemed to be a popular zichar stall and we left impressed!
At first we didn't want to order the Grilled Sotong ($18 for small) but the owner convinced us otherwise. As I quote: ""This is our signature. If its not delicious, I will refund for you"". With such guarantee, we had to get it � I must say, it was really pretty good! The portion came pretty generous and the squid was fresh and not chewy. There is quite a bit of smoky flavour as well! Best to pair with the squid is their secret green sauce, which the owner refused to disclose its ingredients.
The salted egg pork ribs ($12 for small) also came in quite sizable portions, with its meat tender and well coated with a strong salted egg sauce that isn't too dry.
Now we come to their fish head steamboat ($30), which was huge! The soup is very robust and you can tell its boiled over long hours. There were many fish head chunks that had alot of meat, and they were so sweet and fresh! The soup is really addictive and we had to ask them for a free refill.
Definitely one of the best zi char experiences I've had, especially with the owner being so friendly and cheeky. Will definitely be back!",5
"Actually my first time to this hawker centre and was so impressed by the halal fare!
We tried the Ayam Penyet ($7) from Adam Chicken Rice and first of all, the portion is huge! Digging your spoon into the chicken thigh triggers a satisfying crunch from the crispy skin and reveals juicy and flavourful meat within. The rice is flavoured with chicken stock and was fluffy! If you like your food spicy, their chili definitely has the punch. A dish I have no complaints about!
Another dish we ordered was Soup Kambing ($8) from Bahrakath Mutton Soup King, and it was so impressive that I couldn't take a good picture before it was gone� The soup itself was such a thick broth and had a wonderful herbal flavour. Mutton meat within were very tender too. Love this so much!
We also ordered satay on the side as well from Zaiton Satay ($0.80 each) and although they were slightly tough, the meats were so flavourful and addictive. Definitely a great addition to the mains.",5
"One of the more famous roast meat stalls around, Jiu Jiang Shao la's roasts may be leaner, but they do pack with flavour.
Their char siew pieces were roasted well though a little tough due to the cut of pork they use. Nonetheless, paired with their sweet savoury sauce, this still hits the spot.
The roast pork was okay, with the skin just slight crispy.
Their roast duck is the best among the 3, as they were tender and very flavourful. Definitely can taste the different herbs and spices used!",4
"If you are looking for some good Chinese skewers with drinks, look no further! I've been here multiple times and the standard still remains high.
Using #burpplebeyond, we got 20 for 20 skewers, and chose a variety from beef to mutton to seafood and vegetables. We loved how the meats were tender and flavourful! Incredibly smoky, each bite has a savoury kick coming from the chosen seasoning.
My favourites include the prawn and shishamo, as their shells and bones can be eaten as well for the satisfying crunch and seafood umami and most importantly, they were fresh!
To wash all the savouriness down, be sure to get their yuzu frozen beer, as it has an extra refreshing citrus kick. Very shiok!
Bill was about 128 for 3 and the portion was just right for us!",5
"Always a fan of their brunch fare, but sadly this pasta did not meet my expectations.
I had the Mushroom Bacon Truffle Alfredo ($15) and pasta noodles were overcooked and the sauce was too watery in my opinion. However, the nacon pieces were well sautéed and did give the dish their umami flavour. There was a strange flavour in the dish, not sure if its the truffle oil?
With the 20% off main dish from #burpplebeyond, perhaps it can be better used on their brunch fare!",3
"Had a dinner at this posh Italian restaurant and the food here is pretty good!
We got the Quattro Formaggi ($26) that contains a variety of cheeses on the pizza that makes this pizza taste pretty decadent! The cheeses complement each other well and has a savoury flavour. I love the addition of walnuts and grapes on the pizza as you do feel like you're having a cheese platter on a pizza � the crust is crispy and fluffy too, and has the smokey flavour from the wood fire oven.
The Salmon Pasta ($27) has quite a good amount of smoked salmon pieces that were torched for extra smokiness. The pasta are of a thicker Linguine, and are al dente. They do catch the creamy mentai sauce well and each mouthful has a very satisfying rich taste.
This place is definitely great for date nights! Very chill and posh ambience with good food �",4
"[INVITED TASTING] I am no stranger to this posh restaurant with delicious food as I have been here quite a few times, and I was so glad for the chance to try their course menu! Here's some dishes that we had:
Pan Fried Red Snapper: The fish was really fresh, grilled to perfection with a nice flaky meaty bite to it! The creamy sauce pairs well with the fish and their mashed potato under really doesn't disappoint!
Beef Cheeks Bourguignon: Really tender, the flavourful beef cheeks were well braised in the red wine sauce. If you love beef, this is one dish to go for. Love how the onions were charred for extra smokey flavour!
Local Duck Leg Confit: I have always been a fan of duck confit and I am glad this rendition is well executed as well. Though the skin may not be really crispy, the meat was tender and flavourful. Love the orange carrot mousse that helped to cut the fatiness of meat!
Australian Pork Belly: Don't mistake this as fish as you put your knife through this delicate meat; it's really the most tender pork belly I have encountered! The skin is just slightly crispy and the pork does not have the gamey taste. Bloody well done.
Boston Lobster Coconut Laksa ($48): Managed to try this although it's not part of the course menu. Definitely the most extravagant laksa I've seen, but not the best tasting. The lobster is definitely fresh, but we felt like the broth is abit lackluster as it isn't thick and flavourful.
William Pear Crumble Tart: Now moving on to desserts, I love the tart more than the cheesecake, due to its fresh buttery tart pastry, and its sweet yet decadent filling. This pairs well with their lavender ice cream, which is aromatic but not too perfume-like. Wished that the ice cream has less water content though!
Most of their dishes really hit the spot and the ambience really makes it date worthy. The course menu is available on #burpplebeyond and going for $85 for 2 pax. Definitely coming back again soon! Thank you @burpple for inviting and @perchsg for hosting!",4
"If you love your durian, this is a wonderful place to indulge in your cravings! The whole cafe is filled with the beautiful fragrance of fresh durian and we loved the dessert we got!
The durian chendol ($5.30) may be a small bowl, but it is packed full of flavour coming from the coconut milk and gula melaka and they gave a good scoop of fresh durian flesh that smooth and really fragrant! Definitely a heavenly bowl to share.
We got a quarter roll of their durian roll ($6.50), and we loved that the cream itself contains durian flesh! The flavour of the cream isn't as strong, but it is definitely more creamy. Overall a pretty good cake!",4
"Always wanted to try their fish soup and I must say I was definitely impressed! I ordered the usual batang fish soup ($6.80) and I was delighted that the soup has a robust flavour coming from boiling fish bones and perhaps dried fish flakes. The soup isn't too salty and has extra interesting ingredient: salted vegetables. They definitely added umami to the already flavourful soup!
The fish slices itself were generous, and were extremely fresh. With natural sweetness, each slice also had a bouncy texture that I loved! Definitely a good bowl of fish soup I crave on rainy days!",4
"Had a chance to eat at this really popular teochew restaurant and I must say food here were executed really well!
For a start we had teochew cold crabs ($45 each) and they were so fresh, meaty and full of roe! The crab roe were rich and creamy, and did not have a foul smell.
Another authentically teochew dish we had was the Pork Jelly ($15) which was rich, gelatinous and meaty! Perfect with the chilli sauce �
Another dish worth mentioning is their Pig Trotters, which appears to be an off-menu item. The pork trotter was well braised in a savoury sweet sauce, and the meat was probably the most tender I've ever had! The sauce goes very well with some mantou, so be sure to get those!
Their Yam Ring ($18) was executed well too, with the yam itself fried very well as it was crispy on the outside, and creamy inside. The mixed vegetables inside were not overcooked definitely!
As for the mains, the Cai Poh Kway Teow ($12) is worth a mention, as the wok hei is strong in this plate and it was so flavourful with all the salted vegetables!
Will be back again! Seems like a wonderful place for family gatherings �",5
"One of the many dessert cafes in bedok, Denzy Gelato is popular to many living around the area. We had their double scoop waffles, with their Yuzu Mango and Mocha Crisps gelato flavours. The Yuzu Mango was extremely refreshing, especially when it's like a sorbet. The fruity tangy flavours come through strongly, making this perfect for a hot day! The Mocha Crisps had a moderately strong coffee flavour, smooth and not too acidic and had fun crispy chocolate balls within.
The waffles itself is the very airy kind and not too doughy. Pretty much the whole outer layer is very crispy! Wonderful cafe to go to if you are around the area!",4
"If you fancy a good plate of hokkien mee with strong seafood broth and loads of garlic and pork lard flavours, this is it. Their $7 portion came in generous portions, enough for perhaps 2 small eaters or 1 big one! This is a wetter kind of hokkien mee, which tend to come with less smokey flavour but more savoury broth flavour!
If you think you had good hokkien mee chilli so far, think again. Their chilli comes with an extra main ingredient, ikan billis! Those fried anchovies definitely gave an extra umami to the already flavourful and spicy chilli.
Absolutely recommended and definitely will come again!",5
"Now this is another fish soup in the east I would travel to eat! Their fresh fish soup ($4.50) is filled with a variety of ingredients, including fresh fish slices that had such s good bite! The fish slices were naturally sweet as well. What's best is their soup broth that not only has the taste of fish stock, it took on the flavour of fried egg pieces as well. Now that's one good fish soup to be added to my list!",4
"Although not the friendliest staff working at this Yong Tau Foo stall, the food quality here is indeed not bad! Chanced upon this stall with a constant queue and did not have any regrets.
I got noodles with 6 ingredients and paid about $4-5 and the portion was really big! The staff will ask if you would like them to fry the fried ingredients and doing so really did made those pieces taste much nicer, though much oiler.
I actually really liked the soup, as you can taste the flavours coming from the soy beans. All ingredients tasted great with their chilli sauce, which packed a savoury punch. Definitely a stall I wouldn't mind eating again if I'm around the area!",4
"Had a chance to go for the distillery tour and it was such an interesting experience learning about the roots of this distillery and how gin is made.
The tour comes with a welcome drink, that is mainly using calamansi juice and their very own dry gin. Absolutely loved the flavours coming from this cup, as it is tangy, refreshing and beautiful herbal taste of the gin makes this very pleasant.
The tour also comes with a tasting flight, with 3 of their gins. With the Singapore dry gin being herbally, butterfly pea being florally and the pahit pink being spicy and smoky, we loved butterfly pea the best. Paired with just tonic, it's extremely smooth and pleasant, with the floral flavours coming through strong.
With such beautiful vibes and service, I can really see myself coming back to have good gins and fun times with friends and loved ones. Will be back again!",5
"Have heard about their unique omakase where you get enormous quantities of ikura and we were pretty impressed!
The standard omakase ($128) comprises of 9 courses and there is indeed a huge variety. From sashimi to tempera to grilled dishes, they have them all. These are just some of the dishes we had during the course and I must say I was very surprised by the beauty of the plating of their dishes!
As for the food quality, all dishes were of decent quality definitely. The sashimi pieces were decently fresh and the Wagyu Beef was pretty tender but not melt in the mouth though. Though I must admit I was not expecting much when I was served corn, but that is probably the sweetest, juiciest and most delicious corn I've had.
If you love your ikura, this is definitely a place to check out. To make it less painful on your wallet, you can get some discounts via @chopesg vouchers! Definitely a place to bring your loved ones for a celebration!",5
"Excited to know they have opened this other outlet and I'm even more impressed with the food here! We had a variety of food to share including pastas, mains and some sides.
We got the Pesto Chicken Pizza ($20) and the Spanish Chorizo & Jamon Iberico Ham Pizza ($25) and I loved how the crust were not so thick, but really absolutely delicious. The outside is crispy and the inside is chewy. The Pesto Chicken had a generous amount of fresh Pesto sauce, giving this pizza a good earthy flavour. The Jamon Iberico Ham on the other really gave the pizza earthy smoky yet rich flavours and I'm really in love with this one!
Although the Honey Glazed Pork Ribs ($29) weren't the most tender, but they still fell off the bone pretty easily and full of savoury smoky flavours! Glad that they were meaty as well and had enough to go around. The wedges were legendary, as they were so crispy on the outside and so creamy on the inside.
The Atlantic Salmon ($25) came with some beautiful creamy mash, that is flavourful as well. Salmon itself is quite a huge piece, very fresh and definitely cooked just right. I love how they managed to make the skin really crispy!
The 2 sides we ordered, Shoestring Fries ($6) and Tater Tots ($6) came in generous portions, and they were very well fried and so addictive! Definitely good sharing portions.
So glad the dishes except the sides were 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond and definitely will be back!",4
"If you are looking for quality Cantonese fare, this is one place to look out for! Although abit pricey, most of the food here do have a certain standard, especially the fried spam fries here that is coated with salted egg sauce � not only the batter is crispy, the salted egg sauce is rich and creamy and that makes it really addictive!
Sadly, I was not able to take photo of some main dishes that we've ordered, but I do remember the roasted pork belly and fried Hong Kong noodles being the main highlights. The roasted poor belly came in really thick pieces, with the skin being really crispy and the meat absolutely tender and succulent. Indeed one of the best roasted pork belly I've had!
The Hong Kong Noodles, though looked simple with just thin noodles and sautéed vegetables, were packed with loads of flavour. The noodles were well springy and were rather smoky too!
I remembered we ordered a huge variety of dishes and each person paid about $25. If I'm craving Cantonese dishes, I might consider coming back again!",4
"Had a chance to try their Truffle mushroom noodle bento ($12.90) and was really impressed! The springy noodles were well coated with very umami packed sauce that has both good elements of a strong mushroom and truffle oil flavour. The mushrooms were well braised and were springy as well! The dumplings I chose for the set were chilli prawn filling, and I liked it due to its strong prawn flavour, with a heat that kicks in after. The appetiser bean sprouts were well seasoned with vinegar, making them really addictive! I must say this is a well rounded meal, great to order back to office during lunch!",5
"If you like your burger sloppy, the double cheeseburger ($9.90) is one of the best ones I've had. Think 2 incredibly juicy and succulents smashed patties, with a good overall smoky crust and relatively strong tasting cheese. Each bite is full of flavour, making this really sinful yet heavenly! I really do find this outlet much better than the other outlets I've had. The addition of fries and drink ($4.90) was alright, but the burger really won me over. Definitely be back if I'm craving good burgers!",4
"Operating this restaurant is a Korean family that do give very homely service, and I must say their food is really homely tasting too!
Don't be surprised to come in the restaurant without a menu, as the family decides on the menu for you. Their lunch set ($17.90 but varies) comes with about 9 side dishes with soup and rice and all of them were pretty delicious! Don't expect their food to be incredibly flavourful, as they were not oily nor too salty, making them taste like home cooked food.
Fruits and waffles were also served after the meal and I was so surprised to know that their waffles were mochi waffles! Really satisfying with the crispy exterior and chewy interior. Definitely recommended to those who are around the area!",4
"Found out that this stall just opened in golden mile and I must say I was really pretty impressed with their noodles!
Their Ah Gong Signature Noodles ($5.50) came with an abundant amount of ingredients, including pork balls, pork slices and pork liver. Their pork slices are pretty tender and though their pork slices may be thin and some were overcooked, they were not gamey at all. Soup is not too sweet and is flavourful!
Their noodles were tossed in a very old school flavoured sauce, that used mainly chilli, ketchup, vinegar and lard. The addition of fried shallots definitely gave the noodles more umami flavour. Loved how they were springy too!
Definitely a satisfying bowl for lunch! So glad I added more noodles �",4
"Known to be one of the best shao la or roast meat stalls in Singapore, I must say their meats are really of standard.
We got 3 different meats and an egg for 2 pax ($19.30) which we do find slightly more expensive than other places. The roast pork belly pieces were very well executed, as the skin is not only really crispy, but airy as well. The meat itself stays succulent and flavourful. The roast duck pieces were tender and flavourful from the herbal ingredients used to season it.
I believe the winner of all their meats is their char siu, as not only it was really tender, it comes with a layer of pork skin which was well caramelised with the sweet savoury sauce around the meat. I dare say this is one of the best char siu I've had.
Their chilli sauce are to be commended as well, as they not only pack a punch, they were savoury and garlicky too. Perfect with rice!
Definitely worth a visit if you are around the area!",5
"Rice noodle rolls are pretty common in most parts of Singapore, but this stall offers something unique. Their Rice Noodles Roll with Dough Stick ($4) is really pretty simple with just the usual fried dough stick wrapped with rice noodles, but actually really delicious! The contrast in textures between the silky smooth but chewy rice noodles and the crispy airy dough within was really much appreciated! The simple soya sauce gave this dish a satisfying savoury kick. Definitely a dish recommended to share!",4
"Always loved the food in this cafe, and the dishes I tried today is good as always!
The Truffle Bacon Mushroom ($18) is really the winning dish for today, as the flavour was on point on so many areas. The pasta was al dente and it was coated well with the creamy truffle sauce that had a good amount of truffle oil flavour and was not too cloying. The bacon pieces were very well fried, giving so much flavour to the pasta itself. The mushrooms gave even more umami to the dish, making this a very addictive one!
The Pork Chop & Sweet Mash ($19) was interesting, as they used sweet potato to make the mash, giving it a sweeter touch. The grilled pork chop was well seasoned and grilled, with really satisfying fatty parts around the meat. The meat itself can be a little tough though!
The Plus Burger ($20) was pretty wholesome altogether with the thick bacon and flavourful sauce within, but the patty can be abit dry on its own.
The Truffle Tatertots ($11) were wonderfully crispy and creamy within, but it did get soggy after a while. Truffle taste isn't strong in this one.
The Mocha ($6) was great, with a good balance between the earthy chocolate flavours and the aromatic coffee brewed. Not too acidic and milky!
So glad that we had #burpplebeyond, as it helped to cut 30% off our bill! Definitely a wonderful place and will be back for more �",5
"Always been a fan of Matchaya desserts, and their parfait ($16.80) did not disappoint either.
The parfait came with 4 scoops of soft serve, though it was supposed to be all of their available flavours, sadly they ran out of black sesame and hokkaido milk that day. We had the houjicha and Matcha soft serve then and both were so rich! Loved the roasted flavours coming from the houjicha, and the aromatic tea flavours from the Matcha. It also came with popped rice, mochi and azuki, which we thoroughly enjoyed as it goes well with the soft serve. It's good for 3-4 to share and satisfy your matcha cravings!",5
"Saw that this restaurant is recently available on #burpplebeyond and had to give it a try! We got the Bara Chirashi Don ($28 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Wagyu Beef Don ($32 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond).
Both portions were quite big, though we realised that it's mostly rice. The chirashi don came with rather huge chunks of salmon and tuna pieces which were pretty fresh! I liked how the rice is seasoned lightly with vinegar, making it extra tasty with the sashimi pieces.
Though we felt like the beef slices were rather thin in the wagyu beef don, they were indeed tender and flavourful. Wished that the rice can be drenched in a certain sauce, as it was a tad dry eating it alone.
Food may be okay, but we felt like its abit pricey without the burpple beyond discount. Wouldn't be too sure that we will be back without the discount!",4
"Honestly, I wouldn't think of getting coffee from this cafe in tampines 1, but thanks to burpple beyond, I found another good coffee place!
We got the Dalgona coffee ($7.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and we were surprised that it isn't too sweet! The coffee beans used is very fragrant, neither too acidic nor too bitter, and the dalgona or caramelised sugar did add a earthy caramel flavour to the coffee. Coffee is thick but not too milky. A pretty good cup of coffee indeed!",4
"I would think this mala xiang guo stall is familiar with most people who are mala lovers, but I just gotta mention about them again! Me and my friend shared this enormous pot of delicious stir fried ingredients with noodles and it isn't too expensive at $24. We did not order any seafood nor beef.
I like how their noodles are still springy, and it isn't too spicy for xiao la or small spice, which is great for people who do not eat much spice. You can still taste the sichuan peppercorn flavours and the umami coming from stir fried onions they added in. The bowl also does not come with large pieces of chilli which most will remove. Definitely a lovely bowl I will have again if I do have any cravings!",5
"[INVITED TASTING] The Rebel Bar recently released their all vegan menu, and we were impressed with their extensive vegan dishes! We ate a variety of them, from burgers to quesadillas to pastas, but what stood out to me the most is their pastas.
The Zoodle Bolognese ($18) is an interesting touch. The original pasta noodles are replaced with shredded zucchini, making this a less heavy dish. The sauce, although no meat within, is flavourful well with tomato and onions that makes this taste pretty homely.
The Unagi Aglio Olio ($19) was pretty good as well, as the pasta noodles were cooked al-dente and was pretty heavy on the garlic which I loved! The unagi is actually plant based, but the texture is somewhat similar to unagi, though abit too mushy. The taste definitely still have loads of umami, that's for sure!
This is a pretty good option if you would like to drink here too! Thank you @burpple for the invitation ��",4
"I was surprised that this stall actually doesn't have much publicity, because the roasted meats here were really pretty good!
We ordered the 3 kinds of roasted meats for 2 to share ($12) and although the portion size isn't big, we thoroughly enjoyed every single piece!
The roasted pork belly itself has a really satisfyingly crunchy skin, with a well seasoned tender meat underneath. Indeed it is a mystery how they can keep the meat moist, while making the skin really crispy.
They use the pork belly to make the cha shao, resulting in really fatty, tender and succulent pieces that almost melt in our mouths! They were well seasoned too, and not too sweet nor savoury.
The roasted duck were moderately tender and pretty tasty too. The skin was almost crispy.
I must say the meats here are really pretty good! Will be back again if I am around the area �",4
"I thought that I wouldn't be posting about IKEA's food since most people know their menu, but their new Pork Ribs ($13.50) really won me over.
I was given huge chunks of pork ribs that were drenched in their black pepper sauce and as messy as it looked, it was really scrumptious. The meat itself were really tender, like you don't even need a knife to cut through the meat. All you need is a spoon really! The meat was also very succulent and well seasoned. The sauce itself is incredibly rich, with a strong pepper flavour and it was slightly tangy. Indeed a steal for such a delicacy!
Forget about the meatballs, I think this is really much better �",4
"This is one of the go-to lunch places in Buona Vista, and I must say I was pretty impressed with the fried chicken here! We got the Half & Half Boneless Chicken of 2 flavours, Butter Garlic and Seasoned Spicy ($35). I must say that the chicken pieces indeed taste pretty fresh and I'm. Glad that the batter stayed relatively crispy although it's coated with all the sauce! The Butter Garlic flavour had a good sweet salty combination, and I loved the stir fried garlic on top that gave the chicken quite abit of umami! The Seasoned Spicy one had just a slight kick, but the chicken is definitely tender and succulent.
The Army Stew we ordered was sadly just average. Nothing much to shout out about. They gave us a free bowl of Korean Steamed Egg, which was lovely � Who can resist such fluffy goodness!",4
"Looking at the long queues at this burger joint, many seem to love their food here. However we do think otherwise for most of the food items we had.
The Number One ($14), which consists of a really thick fluffy bun, a variety of cheeses, bacon and a beef patty was indeed a pretty good burger. The beef patty was thick, juicy and flavourful and the cheese was melty and had a strong savoury flavour. However, I felt like the bun is really too thick, and I preferred if it was grilled more. Fries ($5) were good, though nothing too much to shout about. They gave a generous amount though!
The Number Four ($14) was some yellowfin tuna patty which sadly was dry. Felt like the spicy sauce didn't complement the fish patty too. Sad this was disappointing.
We had chocolate and strawberry milkshakes ($10 each) too, and they were nothing much to shout out about too.
I think the beef burgers may be a ""can try"", but perhaps there are better places.",3
"[INVITED TASTING] Tried a plethora of dishes and most were dishes I might come back for!
To start off, the sides we ordered, the Fried Golden Wings and Sweet Potato Fries were pretty addictive! The golden wings had a light batter crust which was wonderfully crispy and the meat within was tender and juicy. Honestly this is good by itself. If you like your wings spicy, you can pair them with their homemade Thai chilli sauce that definitely has a kick! The sweet potato fries had a really crunchy crust on the outside and the sweet potato within is so creamy! Definitely a wonderful dish to share.
Next will be the mains, which we had the Fried Chicken & Waffle, Tom Yum Seafood Pasta and Shiok Burger. The chicken waffle was such a good combination, with the sweet fluffy waffles and the savoury crispy chicken! Although I felt like the waffles was abit too sweet, the savouriness of the chicken made up for it. The chicken has a light crispy batter and the meat wasn't too dry! However, definitely recommended to eat while it's hot �
The Tom Yum Seafood Pasta definitely had a spicy sour kick, but I liked how it was creamy which offsets the spicy a little! The pasta is al dente, and the seafood were all very fresh, especially the mussels which did not have a foul odour. A very satisfying dish if you like your pasta spicy!
The Shiok Burger is okay, not much to shout out about. The patty may be meaty, but it can be quite dry. Fries were quite soggy.
Now we come to the drinks. The Passionfruit Sparkling Espresso was actually a very refreshing drink, with the coffee offsetting the sweetness of the syrup used. Though I don't really taste the passionfruit, it was good nonetheless. The Choco Banana tasted like mocha actually, couldn't really taste the banana flavours! Finally the Berry sweet milkshake was definitely instagrammable, but ultimately it tastes like strawberry milk and cream, probably a good kids drink �
Seems like a good place to go as a family, with a range of dishes and drinks to cater to everyone!",4
"Saw this fish soup stall with a queue and I was impressed with their fish soup ($6)!
The soup is actually quite light on flavour and has the elements from not only the vegetables cooked in it, but the fish broth as well. Definitely not the very flavourful kind of soup, but it is comforting. The star of the show have to be their generous fish slices, which were really fresh and meaty! You can also really taste the sweetness of the fish. A very humble yet delicious fish soup that I can see myself coming back again for!
Hock Heng Fish Soup",4
"Having tried this bowl of Chinese noodles, this is probably one of the most authentic I've had.
We got the medium portion of Beef Noodles ($6.50) which came in a generous amount of noodles and beef slices. Beneath all the ingredients lies a pool of dark spicy sauce which is probably what that keeps customers coming back again and again. The sauce has a deep chilli and vinegar flavour, with a strong touch of sichuan peppercorn! If you love your mala, this is the flavour you will like. As much as it gets spicy, it gets addictive as well! The noodles were pretty al dente and soaks up the sauce well. Beef slices were tender too! This is probably comfort food to many.",5
"I remembered the bingsu I had in a previous visit was good, but unfortunately this one wasn't the best.
We ordered the Mango Pop Bingsu ($12.80 30% off with Eatigo) and I was rather disappointed with the frequent larger chunks of ice within the bingsu which were hard and the mango pieces which were mostly frozen and too cold. The saving grace was actually the mango pearls which had a satisfying pop whenever you bite into it, and the coconut ice cream which was flavourful but not too sweet.
Perhaps maybe other flavours may be better. I will still come back again to try others!",3
"Aside from the skewers, we had suan la fen ($7.80), which is like chewy noodles in spicy sour soup. You are to be warned, as the portion given was massive, maybe can feed 3-4 people! Though the noodles were abit too chewy, I really loved the soup. The broth was really thick with meat broth flavours, chilli and vinegar that is really satisfying.
Best drink to go with these dishes is definitely Chinese beer, which was only $5.8 per bottle! Definitely coming back here again.",4
"By far, I think this is one of the most authentic places to get Chinese BBQ and dishes, as the ambience, people and food really did bring me back to the good times I had in China.
We had a variety of skewers, from potato to mushrooms to different meats and they were all really delicious! Most if not all of the skewers were seasoned similarly, using chilli, cumin and pepper spices. The seasoning isn't too salty, and the cumin flavours really come through.
As for vegetable options, one of my favourite is the potato slices, as the potato slices were smoky and had a wonderful crust that reminds me of potato chips. Biting through the crust reveals a creamy center within which is just satisfying.
As for the meats the pork belly skewers were quite tough, the chicken slices were okay but the best were the mutton skewers. Smoky, meaty and yet tender, these mutton pieces did not have any gaminess at all too.
The sweet bread skewers weren't that fantastic, as we expected a certain crust but it was just soft all the way. Perhaps mantou is a better option.",4
"Finally trying out this immensely popular ice cream cafe in Hougang! We had 2 scoops of ice cream with waffles for $11.80, which I find it to be pretty affordable considering the ice cream cafes in Singapore. The waffles, though crispy and airy, lacked a buttery flavourful that I wish was more prominent! But it was alright with the ice cream. The ice cream flavours we got were Lychee Rose and Hazelnut Truffle which were delightful!
The Lychee Rose came surprisingly as a sorbet, and we were glad it was. It was such a refreshing flavour, with both Lychee and Rose flavours complementing each other so well. Really aromatic. We loved it so much that we almost wanted to get another scoop!
The Hazelnut Truffle was thick, rich and had strong nutty flavours. Wished that there were more truffle pieces within, as the chocolate really paired the ice cream well.
Definitely will be back for the Lychee Rose!",4
"Cheesy Tater Tots ($11) will probably be a favourite dish to share, as this came as a pretty huge portion that is good for 3-4 to share. Each piece has a satisfying crunch, with a creamy potato within! Love how they are very generous with the cheese sauce and it is a wonderful addition to the already addictive pieces of mini hash browns.
Had a lovely dinner, will be back again!",5
"The Soy Garlic Chicken Burger ($16) came with a pretty massive fried chicken patty. The crust is slightly crispy and the chicken was really tender due to the use of thigh meat! Definitely well seasoned, the soy garlic flavours were powerful. Look out for the yuzu mayo they put on the burger buns, as they complemented the patty really well by adding a little tartness to the dish. I actually prefer to have the pickled radish on the side instead. A wonderful dish overall!",5
"Been some time since I've been to Lola's and so many things has changed, including their menu!
We got the Duck Confit with Truffle Mash ($18) and we loved how tender the duck meat was. Really succulent, every mouthful of the duck meat paired with the mash and the sauce was a burst of flavours. Though the mash didn't have much truffle taste, it was creamy. The sauce reminded me of a good meat stock, with additional balsamic vinegar to ease the fattiness. Loved how they added a few pomegranate seeds for citrus touch to cut the heavy flavours!",4
"Lastly, I was really impressed by the tangsuyuk! In order to make it vegetarian, they replaced the pork with mushroom, but it was still really tasty! The sweet and sour flavours in the sauce really did go well together. Though the texture of the batter may be a little hard, the sweetness and the umami from the fresh mushrooms within made up for it.",4
"Though I haven't eaten much kale in my life, my friend who cooked kale before said that they did this very well as it isn't bitter and still maintained its bite! It was lightly seasoned, making it a really healthy dish.",3
"Had a chance to try a variety of dishes from the vegetarian restaurant and I was thoroughly impressed!
Let's begin with the stews, pretty much a staple to order from Korean restaurants. The Soondubu jjigae or tofu stew was really hearty, pretty spicy and the stock was well flavoured with the vegetables within! Though I prefer my tofu stew with seafood, this is tasty as well. The dwenjang jjigae or bean paste stew has the umami coming from the fermented bean paste and it is definitely hearty too!",4
"This is really one of my go-to places for drinks, as the drinks here are really quite cheap and the ambience is really chill! This bar is located just under a small hotel and the music isn't too loud here. There isn't much people on a weekday night as well, creating a good atmosphere to chill with friends and loved ones. Spirits here are as cheap as $6 per glass, and my favourite is the Jim Beam highball mega mug which cost only $8.80.
Been here many times already and I can see myself coming back for more!",4
"Heard alot about how popular this Korean restaurant is, and true enough it's really packed even on a weekday night. Instead of their bbq, we were craving some stews and we got the Gamjatang ($55).
When the portion of stew came, I knew that this can definitely feed 3 people. Not only the portion was huge, it came with 8 side dishes! The side dishes were pretty unique and they were all well seasoned, especially the chilli potatoes.
The stew itself was very hearty, not too spicy and had numerous ingredients including pork bones (with some really tender meat in them) and various vegetable and mushroom ingredients. Definitely a wonderful dish that is great for sharing among friends! Both of us couldn't finish the portion definitely.
Honestly quite an authentic place and I do see myself coming back. Have had their bbq buffet at their Chinatown point outlet before and it was good too!",4
"Chanced upon this western food stall that seems promising and indeed they serve up real old school western food!
I had the chicken cutlet ($6.50) which came with a sizable portion of fried chicken that isn't too greasy. The chicken within is lightly seasoned and pretty tender and succulent! Wished they had a certain sauce to dip but chilli will do. The chicken came with a variety of ingredients like baked beans, fried bun, fries and coleslaw which were okay. This does remind me of my childhood!
I would say this is not bad of an old school western food, though nothing to shout out, this can still be a viable option if you are in the area!",4
"Known for their fresh pig liver slices, mui siong minced meat noodles indeed does have a certain standard. The pig liver slices in their Minced Meat Noodle ($5) were pretty thick and they were just lightly blanched. Although the small amount of blood left in the liver may be off putting to some, they were really fresh and soft and had little to no gaminess. The soup itself is actually on the sweeter side and I do wish for it to be more savoury.
The noodles were softer than usual, and the sauce seasoning used has a very old school taste! The vinegar is heavy in this one, and the chilli used has quite a bit of dried shrimp in them.
If you love your pig liver, this is one stall you can try!",4
"If you work around the One North area, this is one good lunch alternative to go to! I have tried a variety of their sandwiches and quesadillas before and they were all pretty delightful! The smoked salmon sandwich ($12) came with a rather substantial amount of smoked salmon pieces, fresh vegetables and a very refreshing dressing within. Though the bread itself can be a little tough, you know its quality bread. Love how fresh tasting the sandwich was!
They gave a good handful of chips that may be a little too salty, but they were still addictive. There is a small amount of coleslaw by the side too which was made fresh in house! Will be back to try their pastas and burgers �",4
"Although there is a rather huge variety of ramen types to choose from in the menu, I find myself going back to my default, the Black Spicy Tonkutsu Ramen ($12.80), because it is this satisfying and heartwarming. What makes me come back to this place again and again is really the broth. The Tonkutsu broth itself is filled heavily with umami from the long hours of boiling pork bones. I love how thick and rich the soup is! The already complex yet beautiful flavours of the broth is further enhanced by the black garlicky peppery sauce, which further intensified the umami flavours and gave the soup a light kick.
The ramen noodles were al dente and definitely soaked up the wonderful broth. The char siu is also worth a mention, as it was slightly charred and had a good ratio of meat and fat.
Been tasting this for years and the standard remains high. This will continue to be my favourite ramen �",5
"Hidden within the quiet estate lies 2nd Serving, which is known to serve mochi waffles! Didn't managed to try the waffles today but tried a variety of ice cream flavours!
The Yuzu flavour was actually not too tangy yet citrusy and it wasn't too sweet too! Very refreshing for a hot weather.
The Lychee flavour was actually the best among all, due to its non perfume-y flavour and yet not too sweet. Very light tasting and definitely very refreshing!
The Banana Roasted Nuts was alright as well, as the banana flavours did not come out too strong and the nuts within were fresh!
Yogurt Biscoff was interesting, as the yogurt flavours cut the sweetness of Biscoff quite abit. Wished that they added lotus biscuit bits too!
The scoops of ice cream were between $4.50 and $5.50 each and they were available 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond � will be back to try their mochi waffles!!",4
"Among the various stalls you can choose from within this hawker centre, Fifty Year Yong Tau Foo indeed stands out among the rest. At $5, the biggest portion, gives you 8 yong tau foo ingredients and noodles in their delicious homemade sauce. The variety of ingredients may not be many, but you can tell some of the ingredients are handmade, especially their meatballs. Juicy, bouncy and yet meaty, the meatballs were a tasty treat! The noodles were al dente and flavoured heavily with their own chilli paste and fried shallots. Indeed a satisfying meal!",4
"We got the Braised Pork ($6) as well, similarly the portion was small, but the meat was so tender, you probably don't need to bite into this. The braised stock was also good, aromatic and not too salty. Rice will be a wonderful complement!
If I am around the area working, I do see myself coming here for lunch!",4
"Yes, one must be wondering why I entered a bak kut teh specialty shop and not order bak kut teh, but I must say, I was actually largely impressed by the other dishes they offer!
We got the Red Glutinous Rice Wine Chicken or Hong Zhao Ji ($6) and although the single portion may be small, the broth and the chicken was indeed very pleasant. It is actually hard to explain the flavour of the broth; it is like chicken soup with a mild wine flavour that isn't too strong. Not too salty too and very drinkable. The chicken itself is really tender and it soaked up all the wonderful broth!",4
"Most people would have heard of this ice cream cafe, and I finally had a chance to try this after a long time! The ice cream standards here remains pretty much as good as before!
We had the waffles with double scoop (~$15) with the pistachio and mochacino flavours. Love the all famous pistachio gelato, as not only it was really smooth, the pistachio nutty flavours were intense.
The Mocha flavour was also really pleasant, with the chocolate and coffee aromatic flavours complementing well without overpowering each other.
Waffles are crispy yet fluffy with substance. Definitely a good cafe to chill with friends!",4
Went down for their wonderful braise and they also sell pig organ soup ($3.50) which was very nicely flavoured with the pork ingredients and the salted vegetables! Love how the pig liver is not overcooked and really fresh. Definitely something I will crave on a rainy day! Will be back �,5
"If you are craving some good homely kway chap, this is one good place to go for.
We had a variety of braised ingredients to share, and they were all really good! What I find unique about this stall is that they have 3 different kinds of intestines, ranging from the small ones to the big fatty ones and even pig's tongue! Most kway chap stalls don't have these. The innards were all very clean and had little to no odour. The braise itself isn't overly salty and yet flavourful, making this a very well balanced yet hearty dish! Love that the noodles also still have a bite to them. Pricing is really affordable as well, at $3.60 per portion.",4
"Interesting how I have never noticed this ice cream shop in town, and their gelato flavours were really not bad!
We got the double scoop ($7.8 - interestingly it's the same price as getting the single scoop) and got the flavours sencha and coconut pandan. The sencha is really refreshing and not too sweet as well. The roasted flavours you get from sencha does come through quite strongly.
As for the coconut pandan, it is definitely quite coconut-y, but it gets abit too sweet towards the end.
Not bad of an alternative if you would like desserts around the area!",3
"I have been wanting to visit this hawker stall burger stall for some time, and I finally tried it �
True enough, the double classic cheeseburger ($9.90) was a unique burger, due to its smashed patty concept. I actually find it quite difficult to find smashed patty burgers and I enjoyed this so much! The patty had such a beautiful crispy crust, and it was definitely well seasoned. With the double patty, I find the amount of meat to vegetable/bun ratio perfect as it is meaty but not surfeiting due to the fresh vegetables added � the only gripe to this delicious burger is that perhaps it can be abit more juicy!
The sides require an additional top up of at least $4.9 with a drink, and we definitely did not regret adding, as the Onion Rings were so crispy and satisfying. Probably one of the best onion rings we have had! The Chilli Cheese Fries, although sinful, were terribly addictive due to its creamy, cheesy yet tangy sauce.
Definitely will be back!",5
"Dry Laksa ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) - though the noodles were abit too soft, the sauce is thick and very flavourful, just like a good bowl of laksa. They gave 4 pretty huge prawns which were all plump and fresh! Not bad can try.",4
"Salmon Mentai Don ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) - mentaiko really can't go wrong and for this bowl they were pretty generous with the amount of sauce! As for the salmon pieces, it seems like it's lesser than that of Chirashi. I still love the rice in here! The onsen egg just pairs well with everything in here �",4
"Lecoq Chirashi ($16 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) - pretty generous with the sashimi ingredients, the sashimi pieces were fresh and chunky! I must say they gave alot of rice, but I ain't complaining because their rice were well seasoned and pretty darn addictive. Love the onsen egg as well, as it acts as a good medium to combine everything together!",4
"Iberico Char Siew Rice ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) - oh my my I think this is best char siew rice I've had. The bed of rice was decorated with a glorious amount of iberico pork char siew, which had the best ratio of fat and meat. Incredibly tender, each piece were so well seasoned with char siew sauce that isn't too salty nor too sweet. The char siew was well charred as well, adding smokiness to an already incredible dish. I really will pay the full price for this.",5
"We found this newly opened dessert cafe and we loved the desserts here! The Raspberry Choux ($9.5) was indeed very refreshing with good mix of textures coming from the crispy outer crust of the puff, the crisp white chocolate and the smooth raspberry cream within the puff. The cream used contains yogurt, which makes it not surfeiting at all. The Hazelnut & Feuilletine ($9.5) is not too sweet, definitely rich and has the crispy layer that reminds of a Ferrero rocher wafer! Both were really good desserts and I do see myself coming back, although they were indeed quite expensive.",4
"Heard alot about their roasted potatoes and decided to order some mains that have them as sides! We got the Cheese Quesadillas ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and added prawns ($5) in them. The Quesadilla were indeed full of cheese and it was an interesting touch as they were seasoned with I believe Indian spices. The prawns were fresh and plump! They gave a variety of sides and sauces which were good complements to the dish.
Now to the roast potatoes. I must say they were indeed creamy within with a good crust formed by the skin. Nicely seasoned with salt and pepper too! Not really mind blowingly good but it's definitely some good potato sides.
As for the Fish & Chips ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond), the fish is definitely meaty with a good flavour, but the batter is really hard. Definitely a pity.
We had the 2 for $12 alcohol promotion as well. The prosecco was alright but it was really small. The gin & tonic was stale and was very much watered down.
Had mixed feelings about the place, including the service as it was confusing. The waiter accidentally spilled one of the sides and didn't replace it until I asked. After getting the sides he stood there looking at me. Not sure what he wanted.",3
"I dare say this is the best Chee Cheong Fun I have had to date. We got the ones with prawn ($5) and with char siew ($4) to go and the wait time can be long, as they make the chee cheong fun fresh once your order. The chee cheong fun is really silky smooth with a wonderful bouncy texture. Love how large, plump and succulent the prawns were � I was surprised by the flavour of the char siew as well, as it was neither too sweet nor savoury. The sauce is not too salty as well! Definitely will order again �",5
"Tried this coconut shake ($5 for large) at Coconut & Fam (Sembawang outlet) and I was very pleasantly surprised by how tasty this drink is! Definitely has a strong coconut flavour and I love how milky this shake is. As you get to the end of some coconut shakes, the ice tends to have no flavour. Not this one because it was a flavour bomb through out. This coconut shake also contains bits of coconut flesh that gave this drink some fun bites � Definitely recommend if you are around the area!",5
"One thing different from this kopi stall as compared to the rest is that the uncle uses a barista coffee machine to brew out coffee from traditional local blends! The queue is about 20-30 mins long and I got the good old Kopi Peng Siew Dai ($2.30). This is really one of the best traditional coffee I've had, as it was so aromatic yet not acidic. The flavour was extreme smooth as well. Although the coffee notes were distinctly that of traditional coffee blends, the smoothness is really that from cafes. Absolutely loved the mix and if I have time, I will definitely queue again!",5
"[Invited Tasting] Ugly Cabbage in Fish Sauce ($13) - looks pretty unassuming but let me tell you, this vegetable pack alot of flavour. The wok hei is really strong in this dish and I like how it does not overpower the sweetness of the cabbage. The sauce is not too salty too. I think even non vegetable lovers will enjoy this!
Har Cheong Sotong Kia ($16) - indeed the prawn paste flavours are strong, but its pretty salty. Feels like I'm eating mostly batter too.",4
"[Invited Tasting] A very meaty fish, this you can eat even without any sauce! The fish meat is fresh, flaky and pretty succulent. The sambal given definitely pairs the best with this. Do note that it does get abit too salty towards the end. A good sharing dish!",4
"[Invited Tasting] - I think this is an interesting dish, as I have not seen hor fun done this way! The crispy hor fun noodles definitely gave the dish more varying textures and a bolder flavour. There is some hints of wok hei and overall I do throughly enjoy this dish albeit a little pricey I feel.",4
"[Invited Tasting] I am not new to this restaurant, as I've tried a couple of their past signature dishes at the other outlet in Jalan Besar. Their dishes definitely has standards, and I was mostly impressed by the dishes they brought out at this seating.
Crispy Fish with Chef Joel's Red Curry Sauce ($42) - my oh my the perfect word to describe this is LEMAK. Each bit sized fresh fish slices were coated with an amazing red curry sauce that flavourful, aromatic, thick with a strong coconut flavour. I think this is probably the best curry sauce yet. It was fun going around the fish bones as well getting the succulent meat. Definitely good to share with 5!",4
"Was quite pleasantly surprised by the Qiu Lian Ban Mian stall in Lau Pa Sat, as their soup ban mian ($5.70) is really of good quality! The noodles were al dente and don't have a overpowering flour taste, the minced meat given were really tender and the soup had a deep fish broth flavour. Best of all, they were generous with the ikan billis given � Definitely wiped the bowl clean. If I'm working around the area, it will definitely be one of my to go!",5
"This is one interesting take on Yong tau foo, because you can get their signature minced meat noodles as the carbs! I got 6 ingredients with the noodles ($6.50) which was indeed pretty filling. One thing I do appreciate is that they seperate the fried ingredients and the boiled ones!
The minced meat noodles were savoury and has loads of umami flavour with a good bite to it. The minced meat were also very flavourful.
You can tell the ingredients were hand stuffed, as the fish paste is definitely nicer than commercial ones. The soup has a strong soy bean taste too! Although a little more expensive than other yong tau foo stalls, it is definitely a quality one. Will be back!",4
"Finally got to try brotherbird and I must say I was really impressed with their crossiants! I had the Mentaiko Prawn Crossiant (~$6.50) which was pretty much well stuffed with mentaiko cream which was strong but not too surfeiting! The prawn bits definitely gave it a good bite and a more intense seafood flavour.
The Earl Grey Chocolate (~$6.50) was pretty much bursting with Earl Grey cream, and I loved how it is neither too subtle in flavour nor too rich (or it becomes perfume tasting). The chocolate is on the sweeter side.
Although by the time I ate their crossiants they were not that crispy, they were already very good. I can only imagine how glorious they are if eaten fresh at the cafe. Albeit expensive, they indeed are a treat.",4
"Went to this zi char stall upon hearing my friend's recommendation and I was quite pleasantly surprised! The XO Fish Meat Bee Hoon ($15 for 3 pax size) came in a pretty substantial portion and the XO flavour is definitely strong in this one! Although it musked most of the natural sweetness of the fish soup, the fish meat was fresh. I was very impressed by the beancurd we ordered as well, as it has this bold umami coming from the dried fish used to cook the sauce. Absolutely fantastic.
The San Lou Hor Fun ($15 for 3 pax size) definitely has the wok hei, but if not nothing too special. The Har Jeong Gai on the other hand is brilliant, as it wasn't too salty and was very nicely crispy and tender. Definitely a must order!",5
"These are just some of the dishes served during the 9-course meal ($468) which can definitely feed more than 10 pax. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much because I am very much a meat eater myself, but this really changed my mind. Each dish was very well executed, with my favourite being the sliced vegetarian roasted pig with honey sauce, as it was not only crispy, but so flavourful by itself and with the honey sauce. Even the appetiser was pleasing, as it came with a myriad of dishes that are flavourful in their own ways. Perhaps the only flaw was that the service was too quick � Honestly this is a place good to hold family gatherings! I do see myself coming back again.",4
"With the large number of ice cream cafes already available in Tanjong Pagar, Natter Coffee & Gelato has something special to offer. Their waffles are actually houjicha waffles ($6)! Although the houjicha taste is rather faint, it still has that earthiness from the houjicha. The waffles texture actually won us over, as it was crispy outside but yet fluffy and chewy inside. It's definitely a solid waffle, not those airy kind!
With the waffles we got the Houjicha and Momo Sencha Gelato ($10 total for both scoops) which complemented well with the waffles! The Houjicha was strong and smooth, not too milky and sweet. The momo sencha was refreshing!
Definitely one of the better ice cream cafes around �",4
"Finally went to a buffet with my family for a celebration, and we found this place not too bad!
The Weekday Lunch Buffet was $68 and there was a 1 for 1 promotion for UOB cards. I wouldn't say the variety is the best, but they did cover quite a few cuisines! The seafood was fresh, the salmon sashimi was fatty (though I didn't like the octopus and tuna sashimi) and our favourite was the grilled section! The grilled fish, pork belly and satay were so tender, smoky and flavourful � I was so addicted to them I took second and third helpings of them!
Desserts wise there is quite a variety, and I enjoyed the durian penget and chocolate pudding the most! The chocolate pudding was so rich and chocolatey!
Though most food are not mind blowingly good, the spread is pretty worth at the promotional price. Wouldn't mind coming back again with the promotion!",4
"Had the trending Japanese infused mee pok, miso based, both dry and soup ($7 each) and I would say I have mixed feelings. Good points were that the noodles were al dente with a good bite and all meat ingredients were tender. However, for the dry version, the sauce is on the sweeter side. As for the soup version the miso flavours isn't really strong, though is still a good soup. I wouldn't travel to eat this, but still not bad of a bowl of mee pok.",3
"Known for their interesting mochi waffles, they really didn't disappoint. We got a double scoop pandan mochi waffle (about $16-17) and we loved how delightfully chewy the waffles were! Not only it added a good bite, the pandan fragrance complemented well with the caramel sauce.
As the for the gelato flavours, we had the Chrysanthemum with cocoa nibs, which was really fragrant! The tea notes were really refreshing. We also had the Espresso Biscoff, which to me was the winner for all coffee gelatos I have tried. It is not too sweet, yet aromatic from the strong coffee flavours. Biscoff bits within blended well, giving the gelato a nice caramelised touch.
Will be back again!",5
"The Ribeye Steak, although not the most tender, was really flavourful. Not only it was perfectly seasoned, they also managed to create a good crust on the exterior, giving it a good caramelised taste. Love cutting up pieces to mop up all the steak juices below!
Really appreciated the service from the staff. The dishes and mocktails were available 1 for 1 on #burpplebeyond , making this more wallet friendly! Definitely will be back again!",4
"Took a trip down to this hidden gem and I was very impressed by their food and service! We had the Sea Perch ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Sous Vide Ribeye ($28 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) and they were delicious!
The Sea Perch was honestly one of the best grilled fish I've had, because they grilled it so perfectly. The chefs managed to create a crispy crust on the skin without over cooking the succulent flesh within. This was very nicely seasoned as well, good enough to have it on its own. Bloody well done.",4
"Came across this cafe within Star Vista, and I was really impressed by the various Latte art that was made by the barista! I had the Mocha ($5) which was quite full bodied, smooth and definitely chocolatey. The coffee notes are aromatic and blended well with the chocolate they used! Definitely a coffee place to chill with colleagues during lunch!",4
"Loaded Nachos ($28) - portion is huge, definitely for 6 to share. The nachos chips are fresh and not too thick, and I love how there are so many ingredients to pair with the nachos, especially the smoky meats. Wonderful sharing item!
Finally, this will be one of my go-to for Mexican food!",5
"Chipotle Chicken Quesadilla ($14) - one of my favourites too. Smoky shredded chicken full of sauce and cheese that is not too salty. The salsa really cuts the rich bold flavours well so that it won't be too surfeiting!
Cheese Quesadilla ($10) - Well stuffed with cheese, I think this is better for sharing, if not it gets surfeiting definitely �
Finally, this will be one of my go-to for Mexican food!",5
"If you like your Mexican food, you really gotta come here.
Baja Tacos ($11 for 3) - or fish tacos, there is a really crispy fish fillet in the wrap that is well seasoned, and spicy sauces really made it all better! Definitely a party in the mouth, especially the sweet, savoury and tangy flavours. Prepare to get messy if you eat with your hands!
Prawn Tacos ($14 for 3) - oh my this is one of my favourite. The prawns in there are so plump and fresh and they were very well seasoned with savoury spices. The salsa totally complimented the prawns well!
Finally, this will be one of my go-to for Mexican food!",5
"Looking for food aside from the cafes along upper thomson? Please try this homely Indian food restaurant! We tried a couple of dishes:
Chicken Biryani ($12): fragrant fluffy rice that is already nice on its own. The chicken pieces are actually deboned within the biryani, and they were so tender and flavourful! Honestly one of the best I've had.
Butter Chicken ($13.50) and Paneer Makhani ($11): both cooked in a similar gravy, they were bold, rich, savory and yet sweet. I actually prefer the paneer more due to the bite that it has!
To go with the saucy dishes above, we got the garlic and paneer naan ($4-5) and they were both well cooked. Prefer the garlic naan as the garlic adds so much more flavour!
If you prefer a crisper dough, you can order Lacha Paratha that is not in the menu. Really reminds me of a crispy roti prata that isn't as oily!
Will be back again definitely!",4
"Looking for food aside from the cafes along upper thomson? Please try this homely Indian food restaurant! Chicken Tikka ($14): definitely one of the highlights. Tender smoky meat marinated with delicious Indian spices, this is really addictive. Pair it with the mint chutney they give and it's perfect!
Will be back again definitely!",4
"Been some time since I've dined at this place, and decided to try something different as well! I had the Aburi Salmon Mentai Don ($12.90) which had a substantial amount of salmon chunks with Mentai sauce which was bursting with mentaiko flavours! Definitely enjoyed this bowl especially with the extra tempura flakes which added extra texture!
The mixed Tendon bowl used to be my go-to, but it seemed like the portion has decreased and prices increased. The bowl is still not bad and the fried chicken fillet is definitely still as juicy.",4
"Been wanting to try this hawker setting tonkatsu for some time, and I was so glad I did. I got their Pork Katsu Set ($11.80) and I was wonderfully greeted by a pretty decent sized katsu. Now the crunch level of the tonkatsu batter is insane as you bite into the meat, and the meat within isn't dry and yet tender! The thickness of the meat was also quite substantial and didn't feel greasy. This is indeed a steal for the price paid. Can't wait to be back to try their curry rice!",5
"Have heard that this place is extremely popular, and decided to give it a try. Sadly, there were more misses than hits.
The best dish in my opinion was the Thai Style Fried Bee Hoon ($10) as it came generous with fresh ingredients and the noodles were pretty well wok fried! There was abit of wok hei and it was flavourful.
The Hor Fun was pretty normal, you can give that a miss.
The Cereal Prawn ($26 for medium) had pretty sizable prawns that were fresh and sweet. The cereal pieces were addictive!
Please do not get their pre order platter, as it was way too expensive for whatever that was given. Only rather cheap ingredients were given and we were charged $124 for just that platter � and what's worse is the appetisers were not even good...
We ordered other dishes but they were not worth mentioning anyway... I guess I will probably just come for their bee hoon then!",3
"Tried a couple of dishes from this popular bar in Kembangan, and was pretty impressed!
Hokkaido Scallops Aglio Oilo ($19.90) - if you love your garlic, this is for you. First thing that hits you is how garlicky this dish is, and the scallops were well seared and were fresh! I believe the pasta noodles were homemade!
Donald Duck Leg Confit ($16.90) - pretty tender, the duck leg was also sizable and flavourful. Absolutely loved the roasted potatoes, as the skin was so wonderfully crispy.
Duck Fat Fries ($10.90) - now this is very sinful, but so shiok. Though it was kinda soggy, it still tasted pretty good. Hard to describe but somehow these fries fried in duck fat taste much better than normal fries!
The desserts were great as well, especially the Chocolate Soufflé ($11.90). Rich, bold and chocolatey, the soufflé was a great way to end the meal. Shout out to the homemade vanilla ice cream as it paired the soufflé so well!",4
"Bring along your friends to this new Chinese dessert stall in Tanjong Pagar, as their cold desserts are huge! Their Grass Jelly Ice with Lychee ($7.80) was enormous! Packed with shaved ice, grass jelly bits, mango syrup and Lychee, I think this portion can easily feed 4-5 people. Their shaved ice isn't too sweet, and has a herbal flavour.
We got their Yam Paste with Glutinous Rice Balls ($5.50) and I really loved the rice balls! They were nicely packed with either black sesame or peanut paste and the skin is chewy. However, we did not like the yam paste as it did not taste like it and it got really bitter towards the end.
I would say come for the cold desserts! The Mango Ice is also very big to share!",4
"Was very pleasantly surprised by the food here! I had the Tempura Udon ($25.80 1 for 1 with Entertainer) and it came with a very comforting bowl of soup probably made from bonito, and I love how chewy the noodles they made in house were! The main star of the show got to be the Tempura they gave, as we really felt like they were fried to perfection. The Tempura crust was light, not oily and extremely crispy. Probably one of the best tempura I have had honestly. Very good with grated wasabi and the dipping sauce they gave!
If you like your noodles even chewier, please get the cold version instead. The chewiness of the Udon is the best I have experienced to date!",5
"Loving the zichar stall in this hawker centre, as they serve pretty quality dishes at an affordable price. This time I tried the seafood white bee hoon ($5.50) and it is so good! The broth not only has a seafood flavour, it is enhanced by the amount of garlic they put as well as their fried pork lard. The portions was pretty big as well, with much seafood ingredients. A wonderful option for lunch and dinner!",4
"Saw that the dishes in Banjara Restaurant were on #burpplebeyond, and decided to do a takeaway! Some of my favourites were:
Chicken Tikka Masala ($19.90) - absolutely loved the sauce that is rich in garlic, onion and spice flavours that gave it a bold savoury touch. Chicken pieces were tender as well. Perfect with naan or rice �
Butter Chicken ($19.90) - if you love a sweeter touch, this is for you! Their butter chicken had such a rich bold curry that is really addictive! In fact, it wasn't too surfeiting and I love to soak my naan in such a delicious sauce!
Garlic Naan ($4.90) - I think among the cheese, garlic and butter naan, this is the best. The garlic butter will elevate whatever curry you dip it in!
Honestly, found the dishes rather expensive without the 1 for 1, but with the discount I really don't mind having it again �",4
"We ordered a variety of dishes, and I must say we were all so impressed! Here are some of my favourites:
Fermented Pork Belly ($22 for medium size) - we were pretty shocked when the plate came in such a huge portion. This definitely can feed 6-8 people! This is one addictive dish, as the pork belly slices were not only really crispy, but tender and flavourful from the spices used. Definitely a must order here!
Salted Egg Chicken ($15 for small) - the small portion definitely isn't small, as it can feed 3-4 people! Love how saucy the dish is and the salted egg flavour is definitely pronounced!
Seafood Mee Goreng ($14 for medium) - this came generous with seafood ingredients like prawns, sliced fish and squid. A different rendition of mee goreng, this one is not spicy but have a strong tomato flavour that is really pleasant. A wonderful dish that can serve as carbs for the meal!
All in all, portions are huge and food is really good!",5
"We were greeted with much enthusiasm from one of the staff in this small burger joint and that made me excited for the food! We got the Cheeseburger Combo with Cheese Fries ($22.40) and we left very satisfied. The Cheeseburger has all the good qualities of a good burger. From the soft fluffy buttered buns that they make in house, to the juicy flavourful beef patty with a crispy crust, this is one good sloppy burger. However, although they used 2 kinds of cheese in the burger, I felt like the cheese wasn't really pronounced.
The cheese fries were very amazing, as they were so darn generous with the cheese sauce! This is another sloppy mess that I definitely enjoyed, though it got abit surfeiting towards the end; too much cheese sauce �
The lime slushie is definitely a wonderful choice, as it cuts the heavy flavours from the burger and fries very well. Absolutely refreshing!
Definitely be back to try our their other burger flavours �",4
"Ordered a bunch of dishes in this cafe selling Taiwanese food and here are my favourites:
Golden Chicken Fritters ($8.50) - now this is bloody addictive. The outer shell is really crispy and the chicken is tender and succulent and very well flavoured.
Panko Canadian Pork Chop ($10.90) - equally as addictive, with an even crisper outer skin. The pork meat within is tender and flavourful too!
Taiwan Lu Rou Rice ($13.50) - I especially loved the braised sauce, although it isn't authentic. The sauce still has a good bold braised flavour and the generous fatty meat they gave was really tender and full of flavour!
Strawberry Soufflé Stackers ($17.90) - definitely a dessert enough to share with 4 people. The Soufflé Pancakes were very fluffy and went so well with the strawberry jam and strawberry yogurt ice cream. Add the condensed milk for extra sweetness!
Sadly, the Oyster Mee Sua ($14.50) was a miss as the oyster and pork intestines seemed not fresh �
All in all, I feel like the food items were pretty expensive, but perhaps I will be back for the rice and fried snacks once in a while �",4
"Finally tried this popular fish soup stall in Amoy Street Food Centre! We got the $5 (with added $2 for fish eggs) bowl which already came very generous with thick fish slices were so fresh and flavourful on its own! The soup itself is of a light healthy flavour and we didn't think they added any MSG! The stall auntie also added a small bit of fried garlic, which elevated the soup with some umami goodness � The fish eggs were definitely fresh, but we felt like it wasn't worth the addition of $2! The queue at 12pm is about 45 mins long; perhaps coming at off peak hours are better �",4
"Found one cafe to escape from the hot sweltering weather and the coffee here are pretty good! We had the Dirty Matcha ($7) and Dirty Houjicha ($7). The Dirty Matcha was rather sweet and not too milky, but we felt like we couldn't taste much of the coffee within. The Dirty Houjicha had the wonderful roasted aroma which really complemented the coffee notes very well. However, it was a little grainy. Overall we were pretty happy with the coffee, but we wished that the cup was bigger �",4
"This Duck Confit ($11) right here is probably the best I have had. I tried a couple of such renditions in restaurants, and this beats all. The duck leg itself is so wonderfully tender and flavourful you probably won't need knife or teeth to do any work. Love how there is a thin layer of crispy skin as well that adds to the texture! The coleslaw, mashed potato and sauce are all made in house and they were all so well done! Honestly, it was so good we had to buy another to share �",5
"Heard about this Char Kway Teow from Zion Riverside Food Centre and decided to give it a try. I got the biggest portion at $8, which is definitely enough to feed 2. They are known for the wet version of the dish and true enough, the noodles were drenched in the sweet soy sauce. However, I do find that this version is too sweet for me! The cockles were very fresh and huge as well. It is a good plate of Char Kway Teow, but perhaps not worth a long journey just for it.
We got the Oyster Omelette ($6) at the Riverside Good Food stall and it was pretty tasty! The omelette sides were crispy and there were doughy bits within. The oyster pieces were so huge and plump! ��
We also got satay and chicken wings from Chong Pang Huat BBQ Chicken and they were so good � you can really taste the char and the chicken wings we're still juicy within. A great addition!",4
"Looks like a messy plate, but this Dry Beef Hor Fun ($5.50) is probably the best I've had. This plate came generous with beef slices and I'm so pleasantly surprised that I am able to taste the strong wok hei flavours within this dish! The hor fun slices were also very silky smooth and definitely not overcooked. Beef slices are tender and flavourful as well. This is one really wholesome meal!
Asian Wok",4
"Finally got my hands on Waker Chicken, and I do have mixed reviews. The Original Fried Chicken ($13 for 7 pieces) were really crispy and I loved how the batter was really light and flavourful! Most parts of the chicken pieces were moist too.
However, the Soy Garlic Fried Chicken ($14 for 7 pieces) had a rather strange flavour, very different from the ones you get from Korean eateries. I would say you can skip this flavour.
Will probably come back to try the other flavours though!",4
"If you love your duck rice, this one darn good duck rice stall to consider. We ordered a set for 5 people ($38.80), which included a generous amount of duck meats, pork belly slices, egg, toufu, innards, rice and soup. The duck and pork belly slices are both very tender, and I love how they are drenched in this wonderful braised sauce that is so fragrant without being too salty. The innards are very fresh as well, especially the liver has only a small amount of iron taste! Really really wholesome meal!",4
"Most people will order their kway chap, but I decided to try their Pig Organ Soup ($6 large portion including rice) and I was delightfully surprised! Not only the soup is robust from cooking the different innards and salted cabbage, they also added abit of shallot oil, which made it so fragrant! There were so many ingredients given as well, and I was especially impressed by the liver slices, as they were thick and so fresh! Hardly grainy at all. Their chilli is really wonderfully vinegary and spicy as well. Definitely a wonderful option if you are at Berseh Food Centre!",5
"Been long since I last visited this Korean eatery, and it is as wholesome and delicious as I remembered. Do not expect mind blowing standards and ambience from this place, as the food served here are more focused on being homely and affordable. I had the Spicy Bean Paste Seafood Stew with white rice ($10) and it came generous with many seafood and vegetable ingredients! The soup is like a mix of dwenjang jjigae and kimchi stew, taking good points from both styles making this really satisfying. We also got a Spicy Chicken Set ($9) and the chicken slices were so tender and flavourful! Love the portions and how wholesome the meal is here. If you are looking for something affordable in town, this is a good option!",4
"This hokkien mee is of a wet version, and it has a relatively flavourful broth (that is abit too salty) and the noodles are not mushy at all. There is a good amount of ingredients including fresh prawns and squid slices. Not bad of a hokkien mee and I loved the crispy pork lard and sambal chilli they added in as well!",4
Their Truffle Cheese Wheel Pasta ($14) is probably one of the most affordable one you can find in Singapore. It boasts a very thick creamy sauce with a good amount of truffle flavours and yet not too surfeiting! I find myself being able to finish this plate myself. Love the cheese used as it is really rich with a slight nuttiness. We ordered a side of Truffle Fries ($6) and it came with such a huge portion! Really addictive. Will be back to try their pizzas as well!,4
"Came in without expecting much and I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food! One of my favourites were the appetiser platter ($9.80) which consisted a variety and the best would be the drunken chicken, which was tender and you can really taste the rice wine! As for noodles we had the chilli pork noodles ($8.30) which came with a generous amount of flavourful tender pieces of meat, and the noodles were al dente and really flavourful albeit a little too oily. Another favourite is the Sheng Jian Bao ($5.80 for 4) which is similar to Xiao Long Bao, with a generous amount of meat filling and soup! Very satisfying especially with vinegar and ginger. I love how their wontons here are have a thick chewy skin as well!",4
"Love their ambience, as it provided a cozy environment to relax within the shophouses. Known for their interesting gelato flavours, we got the dark chocolate rose and zesty pink guava on their waffles ($16.60). Their waffles are pretty unique, as it is a very airy and crispy version. The Dark Chocolate Rose was very thick and chocolatey and I absolutely loved the hint of floral notes coming from the rose! The Zesty Pink Guava may have subtle guava flavours, but the visible lime zest they put really made the ice cream so wonderfully refreshing. Really love this cafe and the ice cream flavours they offer. Will be back!",5
"This is one bowl I dare say it's worth queueing for. You get to see the chef cook the meat slices live in front of you, which is honestly really satisfying! I got the Beef Sukiyaki Don ($14.90) and the beef slices were already extremely tender. The sauce that is cooked with the beef is of a sweet savoury kind and I was glad that it wasn't too sweet. Paired with the half boiled egg and the various vegetable ingredients within the bowl, it was really a wholesome meal! There are a couple of seasonings you can choose to put on your rice, and I loved the chilli pepper one the most. It added another dimension to the dish. Definitely will be back!",5
"Famous for their ramen and their bbq meats, I had to try. I had their Tonkutsu Ramen with Special Toppings ($18) and it was quite an indulgence. The soup, being one of the most important part of the dish, was thick, very flavourful and creamy. This might be abit too salty for some. The noodles were also al dente and soaked up the soup well. One of the star of the dish is definitely its char siew, as it was very well charred. You can taste the smokiness well in the meat! I saw many people ordering the bbq meats, will do so next time �",4
"Always been a fan of the food here, and tried something new! The steak sandwich ($14, 20% with #burpplebeyond) was pretty well filled with steak cuts, cheese and mushrooms which was very well cooked! The steak cuts were flavourful and very tender. Together with the creaminess of the cheese and umami from the mushrooms, it was a wholesome sandwich! Even the homemade bread useful was good and can be eaten on its own. The sandwich comes with a soup, and it was a homemade tomato soup that was alright. Pretty good lunch option if you work nearby!",4
"If you are around the area and would like an affordable lunch, this is one place you can go! I had the Black Garlic Ramen ($12.80 30% off with #burpplebeyond) and it was not too bad! The soup though isn't the richest, it is still rather flavourful. Noodles are abit too soft for my liking. I added the chicken tempura and to my surprise, it was really tender and succulent although it's the breast meat! Definitely a great addition. With burpple beyond, the total price I paid was about $11, cheap for a no-frills lunch!",4
"If you are craving some Korean food around the area, this is one option! I had the Seafood Tofu Stew ($14.90) and it came generous with ingredients! From crab to mussels to squid, the seafood ingredients are fresh. I find the stew a little too spicy for me, but it's definitely flavourful. The side dishes or panchan provided are really of good quality and I especially loved the stir fried fish cake! Service is good as well. Will be back again for lunch!",4
"Wanted to find a dessert place around and chanced upon this gem! We had their Houjicha Gelato with Molten Cake ($9.90) which was a perfect combination. The Houjicha was smooth and delightfully earthy and the molten cake was rich, gooey and not too sweet. We also had the blueberry cheesecake gelato on cone ($5) which was very rich and full of ingredients! Definitely a big place, should be easy to find seats!",4
"So pleased that I have managed to find such a hidden gem! Hippo Family Restaurant offers really good quality zi char at affordable prices, as most of their items are under $10. We got their famous curry fish head ($22) and it was really full of ingredients and the fish was really fresh! The curry gravy was not too thick nor too light and was perfect with some rice. Their Prawn Paste Chicken ($7.50 for 7) was so darn good as well, as it was not only crispy and fragrant, it wasn't too salty as well. Really one of the best I've had. We ordered so many other dishes as well and all were very good as well. Their milk tea ($1.50) is a must try too!
I loved how homely the dishes were and the service from the family was impeccable. Definitely will be back!",5
"You must be wondering what kind of interesting combination of food this is, but you really can get such variety under one hood! This place sells everything from western to zi char to dim sum to Indian Muslim food and they are really not bad! The Ee Mee ($6) had a pretty scrumptious broth, with fresh seafood and al dente noodles (finally). The Cheese Fries ($6) were pretty addictive and they were generous with the sauce! The Salted Egg Custard Bun ($3.20) were sweet and the filling is flowy! The oyster omelette was a miss, you can skip that. A really convenient and affordable place for a meal!",4
"Was craving kway chap in this rainy weather and the kway chap from this stall hits just the spot! Their kway chap is very much different from other stalls, because you get to choose different ingredients to go with your duck pieces. They do not have intestine, but they have duck glizzards! I got pig skin, braised pork belly and glizzards to go with their duck, costing a total of $7.50. I must say, their duck and pork belly slices are so tender and flavourful and goes especially well with their chilli. Their chilli is really on another level; super garlicky and vinegary with a some heat. Their other ingredients are fresh and flavourful too. A really wholesome and comforting meal!",5
"Loved how this cafe provided a chill place to hide away from the rain and sunshine! For coffee, we got the Iced Mocha ($6.5) and Iced White ($5.5) which were really smooth and aromatic! The cakes we got were the Earl Grey Lavender ($8.5) and Lemon Passionfruit ($8.5) which were from the famous Edith Patisserie. As expected, the cakes were really good as they were soft and moist. The Earl Grey Lavender was not too strong and the Lemon Passionfruit had a nice citrusy refreshing touch. What's best is that the coffee and bakes are under burpple beyond! Definitely will be back �",5
"This is one famous fish soup stall at 409 Hawker Centre, and I can definitely see why! The medium portion of double fish soup bee hoon ($5.50) was a huge portion, with quite a generous amount of fish slices! The batang slices were so fresh and were in huge thick pieces. The fried fish slices are pretty wholesome too, especially when dipped in the salted bean sauce � Quite value for money, I can imagine myself coming here when I'm around the area!",4
"Been some time since I've had a char kway teow, and this is not too bad! The $4 portion is neither too sweet nor too salty and the cockles within are really fresh! Probably the only gripe is that the portion is a little small �",4
"Honestly wasn't expecting much from a bar, but the food quality here is really superb. The Mixed Meat Platter ($58) can definitely feed 4, and it boasts really good meats such as their tender succulent striploin and their smoky chicken tikka. The lamb chops within is really the highlight, because its so darn tender and meaty, all with little to no gamey taste. The Salt and Pepper Squid ($16) is really addictive, with such a wonderfully crispy flavourful batter. Their Truffle Fries with Truffle Mayo ($14) is also very moreish. Their Spicy Shrimp with Garlic and Chilli Olive Oil ($14) is fresh, juicy and definitely satisfying when you dip the bread in the olive oil!
Totally recommended if you want to have a good meal with drinks!",5
"Cakes here can be pretty expensive, but they do offer good quality. We got the Praline Noisette Gateau (~$13.50) which had all the good quality of a good chocolate cake: soft, moist, rich and chocolatey. I must say, the cake really does taste decadent! There are notes of hazelnut as well. Really expensive cake � maybe I'll have it once in a while �",4
"Hidden in a very dated coffeeshop, lies this stall that sells old school traditional beef noodles and Yong tau foo. Their Yong Tau Foo is pretty unique, as you don't get to choose what ingredients you want and you live it to what the hawker has that day! For just $3, you get a variety of ingredients, with a bowl of noodles. The noodles were already good on its own, due to the lard used � the yong tau foo ingredients were fresh and very old school tasting! You probably won't get such good quality with such prices anywhere else!",4
"Wanted to try their pork ribs, but they didn't have it that day � We had the Laksa Lobster Linguine ($27 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and we loved the rich coconut flavours and how al dente the Linguine was. The Lobster itself was fresh and succulent. The Nyonya Herb Crusted Snapper ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was fresh and meaty, and the sambal given is really good! However, we both agreed that the portion size is really small. Really too expensive to pay the original price!",3
"Been here for their brunch on weekends, but I think their weekday dinner menu is even better! I had the Miso Salmon Carbonara ($21 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and it came generous with pieces of tender flavourful salmon and a dollop of ikura. There is a whole load of umami flavours going on in this dish, and the thickness and creaminess of the dish is surprisingly not surfeiting! The portion is huge as well.
They were very generous with the cheese on the Truffle Fries ($11) and combined with the perfect crispy yet fluffy texture of the fries, it was very addictive!
The Brownie with Ice Cream ($9) was a really huge portion and it really rich but abit too sweet. Totally will come back again!",5
"If you are looking for good coffee and cakes, this is one place to look out for. The Iced White ($6) was very smooth and aromatic and yet not too milky or acidic. Actually one of the best coffee I've had! The Red Velvet and Blackout Cake ($8 each, 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) were soft and moist. The blackout was so darn rich and chocolatey, and I was in love � Very nice place to chill as well!",5
"With the myriad of different Thai food places to choose from within Golden Mile, Nong Khai is a pretty good option! I had their Seafood Fried Glass Noodles ($7) that came generous with the amount of seafood! The noodles were garlicky and savoury and had a bite still. Definitely abit of smokiness in the noodles too.
The Papaya Salad with Crab ($7) was one of the best I've had! The sauce was sweet, savoury and yet not too spicy and the papaya slices added a delightful crisp. The crab added abit of umami seafood flavour in too! A place I will recommend buying a variety of dishes to share around ☺️",4
"[Invited Tasting] Been going for this stall for their affordably priced mala tang and mian xian, and I am glad to be able to try more dishes here!
One of my favourites got to be their Chicken Stew in Pig's Stomach ($13.80). It boasts a soup that reminds me alot of a thick chicken broth with herbal ingredients. The chicken itself is very flavourful and really tender. Even the chicken breast is absolutely delicious! The pig stomach is fresh as well.
The Grilled Fishes ($24.80 each) are fresh and the spicy numbing one lives up to its name, and I do prefer the pickled cabbage flavour, due to its slight tanginess.
Their mala tang is not too bad, but their Mian Xian is even better. You can choose a variety of ingredients and the noodles are the best! The noodles are really chewy and very slurp worthy!
As for the cold dishes, the Sliced Pork Belly with Spicy Garlic Sauce ($6.80) is really addictive, as the umami from the garlic really complements the chilli oil. The Mala Toss Mixed Mushroom ($3.80) is a tad too oily, but nonetheless still satisfying.
Will be back definitely. Thanks for the invite @burpple �",4
Near Simon Road lies this popular ice cream cafe that boasts really nice flavours like Ispahan and Pistachio and I'm glad to give them a try � We had a double scoop ($8.50) with Pistachio and Jasmine Peach flavours. I was surprised by how big the scoops were! The pistachio flavour was really smooth and you can really taste the roasted flavour with the bits of crushed pistachio within the ice cream. Jasmine Peach was tangy and reminds me of a sorbet. Will visit again to try more flavours!,4
"If you like your oyster omelette crispy, then this is one stall you gotta try. I ordered the small portion ($5.50) which was already pretty substantial! It's filled with crispy bits that were so satisfying, especially with the charred flavour. The oyster were fresh and succulent as well. Totally something I will eat everytime I am in Hougang!",5
"Finally tried the Commando dessert ($2.30) and I loved it! The dessert reminds me alot of bandung, with the red tea jelly and the milk they added. Really really refreshing. The Chendol ($2.30) was probably one of the best I've had as well. It was filled with really thick and creamy coconut milk and gula melaka that makes it so wholesome. Really rich and delicious! Definitely a must have when you're here at Changi Village!",4
"One dish that is unique to Changi Village is probably Chicken Cutlet Hor Fun, and this is one of the stalls that serve it. At just $4, you do get a decent plate of silky smooth rice noodles that are soaked in a braised gravy that is really slurp worthy! The chicken cutlet slices are not really crispy, but they are still tender and flavourful. Definitely something I will get again!",4
"When you have a craving for Matcha, Houjicha or Goma, this is one place that really hits the spot. Their single scoop gelato (~$6.90) are really aromatic and you know they use quality ingredients in them. Their ice cream really do taste decadent, and their houjicha and goma flavours are really thick, especially the goma, that shouts black sesame flavours immediately. Had their houjicha goma and matcha goma latte ($6.90) as well, and though they were smooth, the goma flavour overpowered the matcha flavour. Not for the houjicha one though as the roasted scent was still prominent!",4
"Known for their wide selection of craft beers, I have been to this chain of outlets many times for their beer. Finally tried their food and sadly I was rather disappointed. The Sausage Platter ($32) was probably the only one that was worth sharing and pairing with the drinks. Most sausages were great and it came with a variety of sides. This would be great for 4! Tried the pastas but they were overcooked and was nothing much to shout out. Still, it's a bar and the craft beer selections are still great!",3
"Probably the best Portuguese egg tarts I've tried. Such tarts are best eaten hot and I was amazed by how crispy and buttery the pastry crust was! There were very interesting egg tart fillings as well and I got chocolate raspberry, yam sweet potato, coffee and earl grey. All were really good, and special mentions to the chocolate raspberry due to its thick rich ganash with citrus raspberry flavours, the aromatic real yam paste used in the yam sweet potato and the strong aromatic coffee flavours (but yet not too sweet). Each egg tart cost $3.30 - $3.50, and is even cheaper with #burpplebeyond ! Totally will get it again �",5
"Most probably can't make up what this plate of messy goodness consists of, but it's this mess itself that makes curry rice so darn attractive. I ordered 4 different ingredients: pork belly, pork cutlet, fried egg and stir fried cabbage and it costed me $6.30. I feel like the pork belly is a must get, as its so well braised due to its tender and flavourful meat! Love how they scooped many different kind of sauces into my plate, soaking every grain of rice with the wonderful curry sauce! Only one word needed to describe this: shiok!",4
"Honestly I haven't had much Cuban food in my life, and I am glad for the Cuban Food experience at Cuban Libre! I had the Signature Ropa Vieja ($28) which may be seemingly small, but it's packed with loads of pulled beef. The pulled beef is really tender and flavourful, and paired with the beans and flavoured rice, it really reminds me alot of a burrito filling. The Midnight Flight to Cuba Mojito ($30) was a huge jug, probably about 2-3 times a regular Mojito drink. It was really refreshing with the tropical fruit flavours added, and you can really taste the rum! Loved the ambience with the Latin music played and will be back to try more mains with #burpplebeyond! Thank you for having us @cubalibre.cq @burpple !",4
"Located right smack in the heartlands of bedok is this chill cafe with wonderful vibes! We went there for a little coffee and snack, and we were delighted by the food. The Iced Latte ($6) was strong, not too milky, but the Iced Mocha ($6.50)with Ice Cream was even better! There was a good balance of chocolate and coffee notes and the ice cream made the Mocha even thicker. The Mentaiko Fries ($7.90) was really moreish and we loved how strong the Mentaiko flavours were! However, the fries were just a tad soggy. Will be back to try their highly raved mentaiko pizza!",4
"I think many might find it weird why I ordered my Ayam Geprek ($8) with cheese instead of having it with their chilli, but you really get the best of worlds doing so! Just ask for their wonderful homemade chilli by the side and you have yourself a satisfying cheesy, spicy, flavourful fried chicken to go with your rice � really nothing much to complain about especially when it's also pretty cheap knowing that it's in the town area!",4
"Still hands down the best Hawker centre Western food. You may complain about the 1.5h wait, but hold your frustrations till you have taste a bite of their mains and side dishes. At just $6.60, the grilled chicken chop comes with 2 generous side dishes, and I picked their most popular 2, the herb potato and mushroom rice. The grilled chicken itself is not only really tender, succulent and flavourful, the skin is crispy and the sauce given adds on another dimension! Really a perfect chicken chop. The herb potato has this umami flavour going on which makes it so delicious. The mushroom rice is garlicky and flavourful as well!
The Grilled Catfish ($7.20) was also fresh and somehow it also had a crispy crust just like fried fish cutlets. Loved the dill sauce! The coleslaw and fries were okay, but just go for the 2 popular sides.
So sad that they ran out of their fried chicken cutlets, because the last time I had them they were so good too!",5
"Hidden in KINEX is this tea shop (Little Red Dot Tea) that specialises in specific tea flavours, and the interesting thing is that it does not have pearl add ons! Despite that, the tea flavours are really good. We had the White Peach Oolong Latte ($4.30 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Very Grape Tea ($6.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). The White Peach Oolong Latte was smooth and fragrant and not too milky! The white peach taste was not artifical tasting at all. The Very Grape Tea was really fruity with the whole grape pieces that were at the bottom, but we felt abit scammed because 40% of the drink was foam. Nonetheless, both drinks were refreshing and I can see myself buying the latte even without the 1 for 1!",4
"Found this bar and the food is pretty okay! Though you can give the stew a miss, the burgers are really not bad. We got the Wasabi Beef Burger ($18.80 1 for 1 with #entertainer) and the burger patty was thick, juicy and very flavourful! The wasabi sauce actually goes well with the burger ingredients, making this a wonderful sloppy mess. The fries are pretty addictive, and taste just like Mcdonald fries.",4
"Finally tried fast food yakiniku, and I loved the karubi set ($15.80 for 200g) from Hey Yakiniku! The meats were not only fresh and flavourful, the fats on the meat tasted really buttery as well � one hack that I prefer over the sauce is to ask for salt and pepper to go with your meats. Trust me, such simple seasoning is enough to elevate the cuts of meat! Very much recommended if you love your bbq meats �",5
"Located around the circumference of International Plaza lies a homely restaurant called BAFO, which serves up an interesting take on Chirashi Don. I had their Premium Chirashi Don ($22.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) which had an abundant amount of fresh pieces of sashimi. Out of the salmon, tuna, prawns and scallops, we loved the scallops the best as they were so fresh and plump. Now what that makes their Chirashi Don interesting is their rice. Their rice are only seasoned lightly with vinegar, but heavy on the furikakke. This produces a very umami tasting rice that goes very well with some shoyu in it! With burpple beyond the offer is also valid for their drinks which were very refreshing! This is worth it �",4
"If you are in the heart of the CBD, this is one pretty good coffee you can try. We got the Iced Latte ($5.50) with the premium blend. The coffee was bold, fragrant, not too acidic and milky. Great for an afternoon coffee break! They have the espresso blend which is known to have more chocolate notes as well, which is something I would like to try next time �",4
"Had the lunch sets ($28 for 2 course) here in this really posh looking cafe. The saffron risotto with scallops was really good � the scallops were very wonderfully seared, and the risotto was so flavourful with the saffron added! The cured pork meat rice tasted more homely � and reminds me of a more elevated version of the roast meat rice you get from hawker centres. The coffee and desserts was okay! Really wished they had more of their pastas options for their lunch sets though!",4
"Have heard alot about this bubble tea chain and I totally dig their refreshing teas � We got their Lychee Oolong Tea ($4.40) and Strawberry Green Tea with Strawberry Pearl ($5.40) and both were so refreshing! Love how the fruity flavours didn't overpower the tea flavours, but instead complement each other. The pearls were also really chewy! Love the idea of daily different flavoured pearls. Best of all, the large sized drinks are available on #burpplebeyond, making this even more worth it �",5
"Been some time since I was back at Kohaku, and I am glad that the quality remained as good! I got the Kohaku Tendon ($14.80) and there was a good mix of meats, seafood and vegetables. I loved how the batter weren't too greasy and remained crispy throughout! The ingredients used were really fresh � the chicken breast meat was so juicy and flavourful; indeed one of the best tendons in Singapore!",5
"Looking at the number of Vietnamese customers and the ambience of the place, I was pretty sure this place is authentic. Sure enough, the food very authentic, as the Beef Pho ($8.90) came with the plate of herbs! The Pho we had was comforting. We had the Bun Cha ($9.90) that came with a variety of ingredients such as grilled pork, vermicelli and some vegetables that went well with the fish sauce. We would say that the star of the show was the fried rice paper rolls ($6.90) we had! Although expensive as there were only 3 rolls, but they were so crispy and addictive. Saw so many people that ordered their seafood and bbq, will probably order that next time!",4
"Now this hole in the wall dessert shop might look underwhelming, but their desserts sure are not! Their yam paste ($3.80) taste really homely, with a very interesting addition of corn pieces. With that, the dessert has a sweet and salty taste which I do appreciate! It is thick but not surfeiting at all. We got their Tang Yuan with barley soup ($3.50) and you can really tell its homemade! The tang yuan balls have quite a bit of filling too! Great affordable dessert spot, will come by again when I am around the area!",4
"Looking for good brunch and coffee around? This may be one of your options. Oberstrasse is a quiet cafe just a small walk away from lavender station. They are famous for their rosti and coffee, and they really did not disappoint! The Veal Sausage Rosti ($18) was crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside, just how a good rosti should be. However, I do wish that they season it just abit more. The veal sausage is huge and absolutely delicious, with the crispy exterior and juicy succulent meat within. The Dirty Matcha or Dirty Green ($6.50) was actually really smooth and aromatic! It wasnt too milky as well. The froth on top is well appreciated too! Furthermore, you can get 30% off the mains using #burpplebeyond �",4
"If you are looking for a good quality ban mian, this will hit the spot. Jiak Song is probably familiar to most ban mian lovers, with its many outlets opened all around Singapore. I had the Mee Hoon Kueh with minced pork, pork slices and pork ball ($5) and although the pork ingredients were well seasoned and very tender, the handmade noodles and sauce are the highlights. The noodles were very chewy and had a wonderful bite! The sauce itself somehow has that slight wok hei taste and gives a wonderful smoky umami to the noodles. My only gripe is that it's really a small portion, probably will add a dollar to add more noodles next time!",4
"If you are looking for desserts around the area, this is one option good for sharing. The Taro Matcha Bingsu ($15.90) was HUMONGOUS; can easily feed at least 4 people! There were different ingredients that came with it, including mochi balls, crispy cereal flakes and taro balls! Although sweet, this can definitely satisfy your cravings and even cool you down on a hot day.
We actually weren't too impressed with the Black Swan Soufflé ($16.90). Although we could taste the black sesame and the soufflé wasn't too sweet, the ice cream they gave was way too sweet! We enjoyed the bingsu so much better �",4
"If you are at Ghim Moh Market in need of a good refreshing drink to go with your meal, be sure to drop by K K Beans stall as the owner serves up really refreshing chin chow and soya milk! The chin chow drink ($1.60) I bought was such a big cup, and wasn't too sweet. Definitely great for Singapore's sunny weather!",4
"This is one wonderful bowl of addictive noodles. The dry ban mian ($4) from the Jin Ji Fish Soup Ban Mian has really al dente noodles, coated with a good amount of their handmade chilli sauce that packs a punch! The flavours are amazing in this one. Totally something I will crave when I'm here at Ghim Moh Hawker Centre!",5
"Beppu Menkan offers what I would say a more homely kind of omakase course meal. The omakase 12 course is $108 for 2 pax and they did give a variety of ingredients and definitely loads of ikura incorporated in their dishes. � The ingredients used are all fresh, and I loved their abalone and sashimi! The sashimi slices were so thick and succulent. I would say that this is pretty value for money, considering how omakase courses are usually in 3 digit ranges per pax. Their service is definitely impeccable, because the service staff are so kind and they are very open to engage in conversations.",4
"Known to be a chill place with good coffee, I saw many people stop by just for a coffee break which I can see why! The Iced White ($5.50) was pretty strong, not too acidic and fortunately not too milky as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the cup of coffee, and of course, perfect with quality conversations in the nice relaxed environment.",4
"Finally tried this place! In a pretty secluded coffeeshop in Toa Payoh Industrial Area, lies this Malaysian zi char place that serves up really solid dishes. The Moonlight Hor Fun ($5.50) is such an incredible creation, as the raw egg slightly cooks in the residual heat of the dish, making this plate extra silky! There's a lot of fresh ingredients within as well. Very flavourful and definitely shiok!
The Fried Chilli Pork Cutlet ($6) is amazingly addictive, with its crispy and tender textures, and the chilli comes through pretty strong!
The Dai Lor Mee ($5.5) has a strong alkaline flavour. I will give this a miss.
The Wan Dan Hor ($5.5) is like hor fun but much more soupy! Very comforting as the broth was good. Contains ingredients like pork intestines that wasn't gamey!
Very much recommended if you are looking for wonderful comforting dishes �",4
"Found this ice cream cafe hidden within a humble estate and I was impressed with their ice cream waffles! Their belgian waffle ($6) was pretty on point, as it was crispy and fluffy � we got 3 scoops ($3.70 - 4.70 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the blue pea chamomile is totally worth a mention � it's floral tea flavours is strong but not too perfume-like, very refreshing!! Definitely recommend when you're around the area �",4
"When I knew this hawker centre has Granny's Pancake, I knew I had to try. Their peanut + peaunt butter pancake ($1.20) is packed full of ingredients, and their pancakes are soft and fluffy, while the edges are crispy. Really love the addition of peanut butter as it just makes it so aromatic and wholesome. The pancake is really still pretty good even after it has gone cold!",4
"Those who know this stall should be familiar with their really long queues and of course, the fiesty owner. However, all is worth it because this is probably one of the best and cheapest Yong tau foo I've had! This plate for 2 cost just $8.10 together with the soup and 2 bowls of noodles and it comes with loads of their handmade ingredients. I totally love their handmade meatball and the pig intestines, as they were really flavourful and you don't get to see such ingredients usually! A must try when you're here!
Hakka Yong Tau Foo",4
"I know, you probably don't get what's going on in this picture, but I can guarantee that is you love your braised pork, this will send you flying. They ran out of the usual braised pork rice, and so I ordered the Braised Pork Belly Rice ($5). The pork belly was very fatty, and the fat simply melted in my mouth. Totally not joking about this, but you probably don't even need to chew on the meat! The pork belly was so tender, flavourful and incredibly rich! The sauce is made from a very good broth, as it was really rich and aromatic. This is one bowl I know I will come back for.",4
"Was craving Chinese desserts and chanced upon this stall! I had the Mango Pomelo Sago, or Yang Zhi Gan Lu ($4.50) and it was so refreshing! � The amount of coconut milk is just nice, making this a dessert that I can finish on my own definitely. One of my friend had the Peanut Paste with Tang Yuan ($4.50) and we loved how smooth the paste was and that it wasn't too thick! The peanut tang yuan were very satisfying as well, due to the savoury sweet crunchy peanut paste within.",4
"Whenever I crave Korean food, Jang Won is one of the places that I will go to get my fix! Tried many different stews today, including their Soondubu ($16), Doenjang ($15) and their Kimchi Jjigae ($15). Their soondubu is my all time favourite, especially when you get the seafood version and all the sweet seafood broth gets into the stew. The Doenjang stew was very comforting as well, especially when you get that strong umami flavour from the fermented soy bean! Our least favourite was actually the kimchi stew, because its too sour for our liking.
The add-on stir fried pork ($10) was actually extremely good, as the pork slices were so tender and flavourful! Definitely will recommend the add on!",4
"This zichar place is famous for their crab dishes, but we went for the usual zichar dishes and they were really great! Price are affordable and the portions are pretty big too! One of the highlights is their braised frog legs ($20 for small) which came in a pretty huge portion already! There is a good wok hei to the frog legs and it's pretty meaty as well. Best paired with rice! I liked the shrimp rolls as well ($15 for medium) as they were crispy and addictive and they pair so well with their chill!
If I'm around the area, I definitely can see myself coming here for a satisfying meal �",4
"If you love dogs and coffee, this dog-friendly cafe will hit your spot! When I entered the cafe, I was greeted by a very fun and spacious setting, and I knew that it's a space where I want to chill at! I had the Iced Rose Latte ($6.5) which had a subtle floral note to the coffee which I quite enjoy. Although the coffee wasn't very strong, it wasn't too milky either. Filled with polite and friendly dog owners, I really liked the occasional interaction with the dogs while having quality conversation with my friends! Definitely will visit again soon!",4
"This popular hole in the wall bread shop is known for their sourdough breads and bakes and I just have to give it a try!
The Aubergine and Tomato Bialy ($5 each) were slightly tough, but the ingredients were really fresh and they were full of flavour. We preferred the tomato version more, as it is much more moist.
Although the Gruyere Roll ($6) seemed simple, but the cheese used was really fantastic with its savoury earthy flavour. Paired well with their sourdough!
The Grilled Cheese ($12) was pretty big and had so much cheese in them together with several other ingredients like garlic and onions. Very satisfying but I do suggest sharing this with someone �
Definitely a great find. Will be back!",4
"Not new to this wonderful place. Tried so many dishes and honesty couldn't find any flaws! From the mains, to the pastas, to the pizzas, their qualities are outstanding. Shall name some favourites:
Truffle Carbonara ($24) - absolutely loved this one. The sauce is creamy and addictive, because you can really taste the umami coming from the mushrooms used to flavour the sauce. The pasta is al dente and the truffle flavour comes out pretty strong!
Barramundi Bouillabaisse ($24) - if you love seafood like me, you will love this one. It's a wonderful combination of different really fresh seafood ingredients, soaked in this super rich seafood broth that is so addictive! I almost wanted slurp up every drip of the broth!
Truffle Scented Mushroom and Egg Pizza ($24) - love how the crust is thin and the sides are crispy. Full of ingredients and lots of cheese, the pizza is still delicious even when it turned cold. Truffle flavours are strong too!
Though I didn't mention about the rest, they were really outstanding too! Thank you so much for the invite @burpple and @theassemblyground for the eatup! Totally loved the hospitality and food provided. We can see how dedicated the team is in providing a wonderful eating experience here. Shout-out to the wonderful cold brew white coffee that you gave us before we left �; it's actually one of the best white coffee I've had!
P. S. To anyone coming here, they are on #burpplebeyond � Can't wait to be back!",5
"I was intrigued when I saw that this drink kiosk sells yogurt tea that seems to be an interesting combination! I had the Strawberry Lemon Yo-Tea ($7.80) with and without pearls (brown sugar pearls will need an additional 80 cents) and I'm glad to see that they blended fresh strawberries in! The drink was very fresh tasting, with the sour notes coming in pretty strong from the lemon and the yogurt. I loved the addition of the pearls, as it not only was chewy, the brown sugar brings down the sour notes abit!
As the price of the drink may be a little steep, don't worry as they will be having 1-for-1 promo for their new locations:
- I12 Katong outlet during the period of 25-27 Feb 22
- City Square Mall outlet during 5-6 March 22
T&C:
- Customers will have to share the post on FB/IG Stories and tag their friends, then show it to us to redeem
- The free drink will be limited to Purple Rice Yogurt
- Only 1 redemption per customer",4
"Chanced upon this Chinese noodles stall, and I'm so glad I found this hidden gem! I got the Braised Beef Noodles ($6.80) and the soup was so fragrant and comforting, the noodles were al dente and the beef chunks were really tender. The Fried Dumplings ($6 for 10) really reminded me of the ones I've had in China. Really authentic and will definitely recommend to those that are living or working around the area!",5
"Known to be a stall that lasted through generations, you do get the old school taste from their noodles. I got the large portion ($4.50) and it came pretty generous with ingredients such as fishball, fish dumpling and char siew. The noodles are al dente, but the chilli sauce is sweetened with ketchup which I prefer it without. I would say its not bad, nothing much to shout out for!",3
"Have heard about this laksa for some time and glad that I've tried! The basic bowl cost $3, but I added noodles and cockles, pushing this up to $5. Definitely did not regret adding, as this bowl was delicious! Although the flavour of the soup was less salty than other places, the coconut fragrance is strong. The soup is thinner than other places; the kind that you can finish! The cockles were so fresh they only had a slight hint of gamey flavour! Worth a try if you are around the area!",4
"Was wondering why this stall has quite a queue, and now I understand why! I ordered the medium size of fish soup ($5.50) with their yam rice (+$1). I was so surprised by how good the yam rice was, as it was so aromatic without being overly salty! Honestly it was very addictive and I can eat it on its own. The fish soup contained an abundant number of fish slices, which were very fresh. The soup, although not too salty, was aromatic and flavourful especially with the generous amount of fried garlic in there. Best eaten on a rainy day!",5
"Always been a fan of their burgers especially the B Supreme Plus, but I decided to go for their Assembly Burger ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) instead. I was very surprised that the meat was an actual steak and it was seasoned well. It was juicy, flavourful and was quite tender! Their curly fries have always been a winner, as its so highly addictive. Both outlets really have high food and service quality standards!",4
"Honestly didn't expect much, but was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food! The Chicken Pesto Cream Pasta ($15) had a good balance of pesto flavours to cream. With the sous vide egg, this is really addictive! The skin of the grilled chicken is crispy and the meat is tender and flavourful. As for the coffee, I got the Café Mocha ($5.80) and its really rich, smooth and aromatic! Definitely a cafe I will visit soon again!",5
"Honestly, I have never seen such big plump prawns in my hokkien mee until today. The medium portion ($6) has 4 large prawns and abit of squid and pork belly pieces and the prawns were so darn fresh and succulent! The noodles were very wet and the seafood broth is strong and fragrant and not too salty. The sambal has a good savoury kick as well, but I prefer my hokkien mee without so that I can fully taste the aromatic broth. Definitely will come back here again!
Hui Ji Local Delights (located on the 2nd floor)",5
"Yes I know what you are wondering, what's that orange thing in that cup of coffee... Its Orange Espresso ($6)! Basically orange juice and Americano together and I must say it works pretty well! Its really refreshing, especially in the hot weather! The Dirty Matcha ($6) is smooth but we wished that they added abit more matcha in there. Will be back to try their other coffees!",4
"Within a homely estate lies this soondubu specialty place that I saw quite a number of people ordering! We tried the Seafood Soondubu ($8) and the Pork Soondubu ($7) but personally I liked the pork version better as the soup is somehow more robust, although the seafood version did contain quite a variety of ingredients. I must say, the portion is smaller than normal Korean stew places so please take note! The mandu ($4.50 for 3) is really surprisingly good albeit expensive. Nonetheless, the stews were indeed comforting, and will be something I crave for when it rains!",4
"Drinks at this cafe were really good � we had their Mocha ($5.50) which was very chocolatey yet aromatic; a wonderful cup of coffee! We also had their yuzu elderflower sparkling drink ($6) which was so darn refreshing, especially when the weather is really hot outside recently. Will be back again to try their food ☺️",5
"Was craving for some sashimi, and the Kaisendon ($16) in Teppei Syokudo did satisfy my crave abit. Though the sashimi cubes weren't super fresh, but the portion of sashimi was quite substantial. I really appreciated the wasabi as well, as it didn't taste like the usual one that comes from a tube. However, I was quite disappointed by the chicken karaage addition, as it was tough �",3
"There's a really cool concept where you can have your food ordered from Deliveroo in a really chill setting! There are quite a number of food options here at this Deliveroo Food Market and best of all, it is a quiet place and is a great way to escape from the lunch crowd. I had the Pork Shoulder Burrito Bowl ($11.90) which is a pretty substantial portion although I find the tender pork slices abit too sweet. The Beef Slices Pho ($10.80) is such a good option as the broth was really robust and it was such a generous portion! Definitely recommended for those that work around the area that wants to hide away from the lunch crowd ☺️",4
"Finally back at Food Barn at One North for their sandwiches and it's as good as ever! I had their beef BLT sandwich ($12 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and there was a substantial amount of meat, together with really fresh vegetables within. I really enjoyed the chips as well as they were pretty moreish! The coleslaw hidden behind is refreshing as well. Recommended if you are around the area for lunch!",4
"White restaurant boasts some Malaysian vibes, with really delicious food! The white bee hoon ($18 for L) is a wonderful slurpy dish that feels really comforting, with its strong seafood flavour within its broth. The seafood roll ($13.80 for S) has a good umami flavour and pairs extremely well with their belacan chilli! The Signature Chicken Wings ($10.80 for S) is extremely crispy with strong turmeric flavour that is addictive! Definitely will be back again!",4
"Was craving for some Mocha and this hits the spot! Butler Koffee boast a quiet ambience with very intimate feels, which I find is a good place that can hold conversations. Their Iced Mocha ($7.50) has a great balance of coffee and chocolate flavours and it is very smooth as well! The service is good too!",4
"This is one of the trending cafes recently, and I am glad we decided to give this place a try! The Iced White ($5.50) was strong and yet not too bitter, and the amount of milk was just nice. We loved the ambience of the place, as it is indeed cosy and intimate; great for quality conversations, studying or simply just a temporary break from the busy world outside. Give this a try!",4
"This new bubble tea stall boasts a very pretty interior, with vibes similar to something you will see in Taiwan. We got their Boba Milk Tea ($4.30 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and their Grapefruit Green Tea ($4.70 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and we were so pleasantly surprised! The Boba Milk Tea is really thick, thicker than most or if not all other bubble tea shops out there. We love that the tea flavour is smooth yet pronounced, not the kind that makes your mouth dry. The Grapefruit Green Tea is very refreshing, and slightly sour due to the sour plum they put inside. There are some seats in the shop for you to enjoy your beverages, so do come and chill with your bubble tea buddies!",4
"For army stew lovers, this is one buffet you will enjoy. At $25.90 (30% off with #burpplebeyond) you can a pretty good range of street food ingredients like tteokbokki, odeng and of course ramyeon � there are meat ingredients like pork belly and prawns and we loved the prawns so much as they were so fresh! The broth is abit too sweet for my liking though! For cooked food they include fried chicken and mandu, which were so crispy and juicy, and they pair so well with their garlicky sauce! Their service is very good as well, definitely recommend if you love your Korean hotpot!",4
"Was abit skeptical when I came to the restaurant due to its unassuming shopfront, but was very pleasantly surprised by their bingsu! We got the Berry version ($12.90) and it was huge, big enough to share among 3 to 4 people! The different berries on the ice cream are fresh and the flavours are really refreshing. There's even an ice cream on top! Purchased a voucher on klook and got this at 50% off too � will be back definitely!",4
"On rainy days, I do crave for Kway Chap and I'm glad I found this gem! They have sets of various sizes and we got the medium one ($10). The amount given isn't alot, but I must say all ingredients were delicious! They gave both the large and small intestines that were not gamey, and we appreciated how tender the pork meat given was and how the noodles still have a bite to them. Will be back!",4
"Tonito is one place to satisfy your Mexican food cravings, as the standards here are pretty high. We got basically every single quesedilla available as I fondly remember loving them alot! Out of all choice I prefer the chicken and beef ones. I believe other than the quesedillas, the highlight will be the Arroz Con Pollo ($24) which is Mexican rice with their grilled chicken. The Mexican rice is largely similar to rissoto, and its packed with so much flavour! The grilled chicken is smoky, tender, flavourful and definitely very addictive. Highly recommend!
What's even better, is that most food we order was applicable for #burpplebeyond �",5
"I believe this is one of the lesser known hokkien mee stall in Golden Mile Food Centre. This $5 plate is actually pretty decent, with abit of smoky wok hei taste and pretty strong seafood broth flavours. The dish is definitely on a drier side. I would say this is not too bad! The alkaline taste is not too strong as well. Can eat if you are in golden mile food centre! Remember to ask for the crispy pork lard if you like that umami crunch �",4
"Heard quite abit about this place and really wanted to check it out. We got the Mentaiko ($24.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Ragu ($25.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). The Mentaiko pasta was creamy, but we felt like it didn't have alot of mentaiko taste. The scallops were very well cooked though! The Ragu had very tender and flavourful beef cheeks pieces, but we wished that the sauce was less watery. Overall we feel like the pasta was not bad, but really have more potential. With #burpplebeyond, it's worth it!",3
"Simply loved this place. The cafe not only has a very chill ambience for you to have a good break with your friends or loved ones, the coffee here is really good as well. The flat white ($7.50) was smooth, bold and yet not too acidic and dry. The Matcha Latte Expresso ($7.50) is very good as well as it was very smooth and aromatic. Very rarely I've drank Matcha Latte that is this smooth. Definitely will be back!",5
"Actually been quite some time since I've been to this cafe, and the ice cream is still so good! We got the Affrogato ($7.80) with their premium dark chocolate ice cream and it's the perfect combination! The dark chocolate ice cream indeed is one of the best I've tried �",4
"Although looks like a messy bowl, it's actually really slurp worthy. We got the Dry Beef Noodles ($6) and I love how savoury and peppery the sauce is! The sauce contains alot of five spices flavours as well. The beef slices are also pretty tender. Soup is aromatic and beefy! Something I will get when I'm around the area �",4
"You probably see minces meat noodles in almost every coffeeshop, but this is different. The queue already tells you that this may be good, and I must say the portions for everything are generous! The noodles are nice and springy, the chilli packs a savoury punch and the ingredients are fresh. Definitely something I will crave if I'm around the area!",4
"Hyang Yeon's Premium Buffet ($42) entitles you to a huge plethora of food dishes, including different cuts of meats, stews and appetisers. To start of, the small dishes or panchan that came had a huge variety and they were all so good! The appetisers that we chose, steamed egg and seafood pancake were very freshly made as well, especially the pancake as it was crispy on the outside �. I honestly think its one of the best I've had!
The meats were very fresh as well, and we especially love the pork belly, marinated pork belly and beef short rib. All were so juicy, sweet and delicious! Though we only can get a portion of beef each for the normal premium buffet, it's good enough because there's so much food and we ordered only a portion for all meats. The stew was very comforting as well!
Long story short, all are fresh and delicious and will be back again for their ala carte dishes!",5
"One of my favourite pig organ soup stall. At just $5, you can a huge bowl of robust and peppery soup that contains a generous amount of pig organ ingredients including spine meat, pig liver and stomach! Love the ingredients, especially the pig liver as it is just slightly grainy. This also comes with a bowl of rice with loads of braised meat, that is not too salty and complements the soup so well!
Bao Bao Pig's Organ Soup (01-96)",4
"Finally able to satisfy my ramen cravings at none other than one of my favourite Keisuke ramen outlets. I got the Black Spicy Tonkutsu Ramen ($12.90) and I love how peppery, garlicky and flavourful the soup is. The noodles are al dente and the char siu is very tender! Really a comforting meal together with the free flow eggs and bean sprouts!",5
"I believe the highlights of the dishes I've tried in this coffee shop is this plate of Hokkien Mee ($4/5, $5 shown here) as I have finally found another hokkien mee that has a strong wok hei. Every mouthful of this slurpy goodness is a strong hit of wok hei and paired with their aromatic sambal, this is definitely satisfying. I guess the only down point is that the prawn broth flavour isn't very strong, but it's still a darn good plate of hokkien mee overall.",5
"Back here again because the food here is just too good. This time round I had something else, which was the Miso Nagano Pork ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). Although the pork was just slightly tough, the fat and the sauce made up for it because its just too addictive. We had our favourite burger, the B Supreme ($23 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) as the burger was fantastic with the truffle sauce, the cheddar and the juicy patty. The curly fries are addictive too! Definitely will be back here to try their other dishes!",4
"I was very pleasantly surprised as the broth of this famous pig organ soup ($4.50) is nothing I've tried, as it is sweet and herbally, as compared the usual savoury broth that is deprived from salted preserved vegetables. The ingredients in this bowl is fresh and generous too! The chilli is so addictive too, as it not only has a kick, it's savoury style really complemented the ingredients and soup! Should have gotten the bigger bowl �",4
"I may have found the place with one of the thickest dark chocolate gelato! We got the regular cup ($9) with 2 scoops: 1 pistachio & sweet potato and 1 dark chocolate. The former is very smooth, actually quite rare for many pistachio gelato I've tried. I felt like the sweet potato addition doesn't really complement the pistachio! However the dark chocolate is so good as it is really rich and bold! The gelato texture is wonderfully sticky as well!",4
"Now I dare say this one of the best roast meats I've had. We got the char siew, roasted duck and roasted pork belly for 2 pax ($14) and the amount given was pretty substantial! The Char Siew was tender, sweet and smoky, the Dan Gui Roasted Duck was tender, full of flavour and definitely slightly herbally! The Roasted Pork Belly is definitely one of my favourites, as the skin was so darn crispy and the meat is tender and succulent � oh and you gotta put the sauce as well, so smoky and aromatic! Recommended for those in the East!",5
"Doesn't look like much but really found a wonderful deal for a weekday lunch. The Classic Beef Burger ($11.90 +$1.50 cheese 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is really pretty good at its discounted price! The patty itself is pretty tender and succulent, and the fries are really addictive! Honestly really nothing much to complain about considering this is just $6 with the #burpplebeyond. Pair it with a pint of beer, this is one satisfying lunch �",4
"Actually my first time trying out Japanese BBQ and it is really not bad! Gyu-Kaku is best known for their buffets, but we got their lunch sets instead. The most premium you can go for is their Japanese Wagyu set ($48), which consists of 11 pieces of Wagyu of different cuts. I must say, the marbling is beautiful. After grilling them to medium rare and pairing it with some salt, the glistening pieces of meat are so tender, succulent and flavourful. There's so much intramuscular fat it's so tasty!
If you are looking for more value for money options, they do have the Kurobuta and Karubi & Harami set ($25 each) that is also pretty good! For the Kurobuta set I really enjoyed the Jowl pieces, as they were really fatty and satisfying!
However I must say I wasn't very full so perhaps I might go for the buffet!",4
"Wanted to try this cafe for the longest time and I am glad that I did. We got the Fry-up ($23), which was a heaping amount of food and had a great variety! All components were sautéed well and I especially loved their beans as they were homemade! The Truffle Scrambled Eggs ($23) came with a huge portion of scrambled eggs that had a good truffle fragrance. Paired with the toast underneath, it's a comforting breakfast! The Brekkie Burg ($19) had a good amount of eggs inside too, but what impressed me was how thick and succulent the patty was! Lastly the Eggs Benjamin ($21) was good but was normal as compared to the others we've had. The best part is that we saved so much via the use of #burpplebeyond � Definitely coming back again!",5
"Hidden in a quiant neighbourhood lies yocha, that serves up pretty good bubble tea and ice cream! We had their teas this time round. The Roasted Sencha had a good smoky flavour and we love how the tea flavour is really strong! We wanted something refreshing, and the Yuzu Grapefruit Tea definitely quenched our thirst. Very aromatic yet citrusy, this is a must try! Be sure to get it using #burpplebeyond because the total bill for these 2 goodness was just $5.40!",4
Finally tried this cafe! I had the Rosti with Bratwurst ($19) and although was disappointed that the bratwurst were pretty small but they were indeed juicy. The rosti was very well done with a good crispy exterior and soft interior. Love the flavours! However I was very disappointed by the bulletproof coffee ($5.5) because honestly it taste like coffeeshop kopi gao �,3
"Did not have beef noodles in a long while, and I am glad to have my fix at tongue tip! The large bowl of signature beef noodles ($12.90) was definitely very satisfying. The broth was very comforting and so full of flavour I had to finish it. So glad for the huge selection of noodle types, as I can choose my favourite thicker noodles �",4
"If you love ban mian and love fish soup, why not have both? Lai Lai Handmade Noodle from Whampoa Food Centre (Blk 90 one) offers fish soup with the addition of handmade noodles. I got the double fish u mian ($6) and I must say its so darn good! The soup itself is made from fish broth and you get that wonderful umami. The noodles itself are very springy, definitely slurp worthy! The sliced fish meat itself is very fresh and succulent, with a firm bite � let's not forget the fried fish slices that are actually still a little crispy and yet juicy on the inside! A perfect bowl!",5
"Seems to be a popular Korean food place in Marina Square, and wanted to check it out. The Korean dish cooked here are not bad! The Bulgogi Jjigae ($11.90) was very comforting and we liked how it was not too salty. Pretty decent ingredients within! The Spicy Boneless Chicken ($10.90) was not spicy at all, but we love how garlicky the sauce was together with the tender meat. Super addictive! The Salmon and Cheese Roll ($6.90) was good but we felt like it was abit too small. We saw many people order the Dakgalbi and Stir Fried Pork. Will try that next time! �",4
"Although hidden in a very secluded area, this is one bakery I will recommend. They do not have the tables for you to eat on, but at least they have a couple of seats outside to enjoy their bakes. The Pain Au Chocolate ($7) is very well done, with crispy buttery pastry and bold luxurious melty dark chocolate hidden within and on top. This is one messy pastry to eat! We also tried the Almond Croissant ($7) which was stuffed with a good amount of ground almond and very fresh almond pieces on the top! Definitely recommended for nut lovers! Will be back �",4
"If you are looking for a chill place to study, work or just talk, this might be one of the place you will be interested in. The cafe has a modern cozy feel, and the food here are pretty good! The Iced Latte ($5) was thick, bold and came in a huge cup! The Dark Chocolate Tart ($8.50) was very impressionable, as the lovely chocolate aromatic notes came strong together with its very crunchy outer tart crust! It went so well with the inner raspberry jam, as it made the tart less surfeiting, especially when it's rich. Definitely will be back!",4
"Just some random photos of dishes served during their Kei Hachi Lunch Omakase ($128) because its too hard to choose specific favourites from their beautiful course meal. All of their food in the course are right on point and so darn delicious. Each food item is presented like a form of art and paired with the beautiful ambience, this is one hell of a treat. You get a huge variety of different food preparation styles and definitely a filling meal by the end of the course. Loved the hospitality of the chefs and the servers. Highly recommended if you love Japanese food and would like a good treat! Indeed the best meal I have ever had so far ��",5
"Heard much about their cakes and pastries and had to come! We got their Iced Mocha ($6.5) and the Iced Latte ($5.5) and we were impressed by how rich the chocolate was in the Mocha and how aromatic the Latte was! We ordered the Matcha cake ($8.50) as well, and it was not too sweet and had a good earthy flavour from the Matcha! We first tasted the yogurt, then the matcha, then the white chocolate and almonds coating! It was a beautiful combination of flavours � however, we felt that the cafe was abit out of the way...",4
"Once I entered the restaurant, I was greeted by a very cozy ambience that is definitely perfect for any dates or wonderful time with your friends. We ordered the bao lunch set ($16 each), and they came with a refreshing Iced citrus tea, a edamame salad and any 3 baos of your choice. The salad was actually very appetising, as I find myself busy munching through the edamame very happily. The baos are actually a zhnged up version of the traditional Kong Ba Baos, and my favourites are the Chilli Crab, Salmon Mentaiko and Truffle Mushroom.
The Chilli Crab Bao was bursting with crabmeat and they really nailed the sauce! The Fried Salmon in the Salmon Mentaiko Bao was fresh and crispy, with a good amount of umami mentaiko. The truffle mushroom had a good amount of truffle taste, and the shitake mushroom was so thick and juicy! Will be back again!",5
"This place really throws me back to Japan, and I'm glad that their prices are similarly affordable! The best of all we've got was the Yakiniku Bowl with Sous Vide Egg ($9.40 L sized) and my oh my it was full of tender beef slices that were soaked in a good savoury sauce. The sous vide was a wonderful addition! The Gyu Don with triple cheese ($8.40 L sized) on the other hand was not that great as it was too dry. Yes there was alot of cheese on it but I wished they had the yakiniku sauce all over. The Uji Matcha Latte ($4.50) wasn't good either, as it was powdery and there wasn't much Matcha taste. I will still come back for the yakiniku bowl though!",4
"I feel like it's quite hard to find specialty soba shops in Singapore, and I'm glad to have found one! I got the Hot soba with Tonkatsu ($17) and I was delighted by the authenticity of the food! The soba noodles had a very good bite to it and the soup was fantastic � not too salty and yet flavourful. However, the Tonkatsu was really quite tough though, maybe the beef slices are better. Overall, I will come back here again but I do find the price really abit high.",4
"With the rainy weather these few days, I do crave warm bowl of fish soup. I chanced upon this stall on my trip to Berseh Food Centre, and was delightedly surprised to see a long line at this hidden stall. The fish soup here only comes with both fried and fresh fish slices, and 2 sizes ($6 and $8). The $6 portion I ordered was already bursting with fish slices and they were all so fresh! The fresh slices were so thick, flaky and succulent � the fried slices are actually parts with bones, and they provide so much flavour to the soup. The soup itself is so robust and flavourful, and has a tinge of ginger, hence the colour. Paired with their garlic chilli, I dare say this is one of the best fish soup I've had so far.",5
"What this rainy weather calls for: a warm bowl of beef noodles � Recently I was craving some Thai beef noodles, and I was glad to have my fix at Flying Pig. The Beef Noodles ($7) boast an incredibly addictive rich soup and numerous ingredients including beef balls, beef shank and beef tendon. You can change your noodles to a variety of kinds that they have, and hence I got the egg noodles. Top it off with their pork lard, this is one comforting meal. Will be back to try their crab omelette!",4
"Finally tried this restaurant although it's been on my wishlist for the longest time � and I really love the pasta dishes here! We had the Seared Prawn Mentaiko ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and it has huge umami seafood flavours coming from the prawn butter and mentaiko used to season this. The pasta are handmade, so no doubt they are cooked perfectly al dente. The prawns are so succulent too!
We had a seabass in tomato broth ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and although the seabass was a total hit as it was so darn fresh, sweet and flaky, we weren't used to the tomato broth although comforting!",4
"Found a neighbourhood cafe in the area, and I totally love this place! Once you step in, you are greeted by a very comfortable chill vibe that is perfect to for long conversations with your friend or loved ones � We had the Iced White ($6.50) and Iced Mocha ($7) and they both are very aromatic. While the white was good, I really preferred the Mocha more as it has a very balance of chocolate and coffee flavours. Furthermore it is really thick! Will be back when I'm in the area ☺️",4
"First look and you will notice that the place resembles a retro diner, with good chill vibes! The food that comes next arrive in GLORIOUS portions � We had the Baby Back Ribs ($41.95) which was not only generous, but so darn tender and smoky. You really don't need a knife for this. I dare say this is the best pork ribs that I've had so far! The sides were worth mentioning as well, especially the fries and beans �
We also had the Beef and Chicken Fajitas ($34.95) and there were generous portions of protein and sides to build your own wraps. I must say this taste healthy, as the proteins were lightly seasoned.
I am definitely coming back for burgers, as they look so darn enourmous and juicy. The mains are available 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond, making this so much more worth it! Do come if you are craving a good hearty meal � Thank you @hardrockcafesingapore for having us!",5
"I have been to this place many times and really the Australian Pork Jowl ($25) is a must get. Tender, well charred and very flavourful. For a change we got the Pan-fried Red Snapper ($24) which was really fresh, succulent and I love the crispy pan-fried skin! The mash that was under was very creamy and buttery too. The vibes of this place is very romantic as well, great for date night!",4
"Have been wanting to try this cafe for a long while. With the #burpplebeyond, we got the Orh Nee Tart ($8.50) that was smooth and creamy. Though the yam taste wasn't too strong, I still appreciated the tart pretty well. The Bandung Lychee Tart ($8.50) was rather disappointing though... As the tart was soggy and it was too sweet. I liked the bursting lychee balls though �
As for the drinks, we believe that the Crack of Dawn ($7.50) is a must get as its so instagrammable and is very very refreshing especially on a hot day. The Kopi Jawa ($7.50) can be really sweet so do ask them to cut the sugar by half or it gets way too surfeiting!
Love how the 2nd floor has great chill vibes, and will be great if you are studying!",4
"Although the Niang Tou Fu items may be abit more expensive than other places at $0.80 a piece, they are really very tasty. The fried tofu skin you see on top is what most people will get, because it's just so satisfying especially with their chilli sauce. One other item worth mentioning is their bringal or eggplant, that contains a beautiful savory paste and is fried once before thrown in the soup. Actually something I might crave when I am in Katong!",4
"Many will agree with me that Level33's view especially from the terrace is simply stunning. Overlooking the whole marina bay at such a good angle, you will be in for a treat with the sunset and night views.
We had the beer cocktails ($23 each) to go with the splendid view and they were wonderful. I can imagine their beer alone to taste even better.
To go with the cocktails, we had their fresh oysters ($32 for half dozen) and they were HUGE, SUCCULENT AND SO DARN FRESH � Definitely quality oysters that are bloody addictive. A must get if you are going to splurge abit hehe
The Local Seabass Rissoto ($33) that we had were fresh and paired well with the cream sauce! The beer malt rissoto, though interesting, were a tad too hard.
The Iberico Pork Jowl ($36) were smoky and very flavourful, but they weren't really tender though!
I would say the views and oysters are definitely worth coming for, but the mains were sadly not too enticing for me.",4
"One will find a gastronomical experience here definitely, as you will experience so many different flavour profiles from their dinner omakase ($100). We realised that we really cannot pick a favourite among the dishes served as most were so darn good. All seafood ingredients served are really fresh, and you really don't need the soya sauce because they are all so flavourful! There is a total of about 15-17 courses, and although most were small bites, they were more than enough to make us full. In fact many in the restaurant were saying that they were already filled towards the end of the course! Really felt like it's worth the price �",5
"Never thought that there will be a cafe hidden within Sim Lim Square, but this cafe is rather promising indeed. The cakes are pretty good and comes in a rather generous slice. The Earl Grey Lavender ($8.50) has a good hint of Earl Grey and lavender tea flavours that makes it really aromatic. The chocolate crunch ($8.50) had mini chocolate balls in it that were satisfying with the chocolate cake!
We had both the Mocha and Hazelnut Latte ($6.50 each) and they were aromatic too! Maybe just abit too sweet.
Perhaps the downside of place I feel is that everyone is SOOOO quiet and I'm quite a loud person... But other than that there's #burpplebeyond!",4
"This is a big hype, and I tried the Iced Dark Latte ($9.50) which is essentially mocha, and I must say it is really pretty thick and fragrant � the coffee notes are strong but not too overpowering nor too acidic. The chocolate used was of good quality, hence making this drink taste really decadent � perhaps its a good treat once in a while!",5
"Many will know this brand of coffee, and they really don't disappoint. The Iced Dark Latte ($9) was very bold in flavour as usual, and has a good chocolate flavour. Great if you like your coffee sweeten! The Iced Latte ($8) was also really good, with a very good coffee fragrance. Slightly bitter, just the way I like it! But yes it's expensive coffee HAHAHAHA so once in a while �",4
"Came all the way from the far east to this coffee place, and left without any regrets. The interior of the place is already stunningly beautiful, and the drinks are very unique as well. The coffee with Matcha ($9) or Dirty Matcha, has a deep aromatic Matcha flavour, with a hint of coffee that makes this such a complex drink, and definitely for those who loves their drinks heavy. The Yuzu Summer Fizz ($9) is very interesting as well, as its a sour, refreshing fizzy coffee drink � really good especially in Singapore's heat! Really worth a trip down I feel!",5
"Now this is definitely one of the best hidden find so far. The Iced Latte from Pyroast ($5) is really aromatic, and it is really smooth. Even after the ice melts the coffee still remains rather flavourful. Definitely one of the better coffee that I've had so far! This place is located in Sprout Hub, a good place to study or work especially with such good coffee!",5
"Absolutely stunning. We were very pleasantly surprised by the coffee we ordered! We had the Ghana Mocha ($4.90) which had such deep flavours of good chocolate that does not overpower the coffee. The Uji Matcha Coffee ($4.90) was so aromatic and the Matcha flavours are strong. We ordered both Iced and they were not diluted even after the ice have melted! Definitely one of the best mocha and matcha coffee I've tried, and best part is they are offering such quality at a good price. I dare say their quality are comparable to the more expensive coffees I've had.
One interesting and thoughtful thing about them is that their cups come with a sheet on top of their coffee, minimizing spillage as much as possible.",5
"SYIP cafe is a recently opened place that is gaining popularity and I can see why! From the aesthetic looks, to the interesting drinks and the very friendly staffs, this place has it all. The SYIP White Coffee ($6.50) is honestly one of the best white coffee or Latte that I've had. The coffee itself is very smooth and aromatic, and the whipped cream on top makes the drink bold and creamy. Surprisingly, I didn't find this coffee having too much milk in it. The Matcha Strawberry Latte ($7) is very interesting, as the strawberry added a fresh critus dimension to the fragrant matcha latte, making it pretty refreshing. Definitely will be back �",5
"Recently I've been on a coffee hunt, finding the good places in Singapore, and this is one good hidden gem. We got the peppermint mocha ($5.5) and their seasonal drink, the dirty Matcha ($7.50). The peppermint mocha is very pleasant, smooth and aromatic, with rather strong peppermint taste! The dirty Matcha is really a pretty big cup, and the matcha, chocolate and coffee flavours really do blend well together. Not too grainy, it has really good, bold and aromatic flavours. One of the better coffees from cafes I've had!
Oh and we had their yuzu cake ($5) as well and it was very good too! The citrus flavours are tangy yet fragrant, but one thing we didn't like was that it had too much cream, too little cake �",4
"Hidden in a humble kopitiam in Hougang is this stall that sells some darn good hokkien mee ($4/5) at night. You know its good when there's a huge queue for the beautiful plate of slurp-worthy goodness. The broth used is very thick and flavourful, and ingredients are very fresh. It's interesting how they use some kind of braised meat as well! This is one shiok meal but I must warn you, the Hawker does not really adhere to his opening hours so you will be lucky if you are able to catch him �",4
"Fresh is the word I will use to describe the food here. From the bun to the patty to even the sauce, the burgers here really fresh tasting. The What The Fish Burger ($8) consist of dory fish that are very beautifully charred and goes very well with the charred zucchini inside! The Classic Beef Burger ($7.50) is juicy but yet not too salty nor oily. I think what hits me most is the hand cut fries ($2.50) which were so fresh and fluffy on the inside. It's bursting with potato flavours � The queue is pretty long here so be sure to make reservations!",4
"I know, it looks like a very normal bowl of fishball noodles you find everywhere but this is really different. The fishballs and meatballs given are all handmade, and are very meaty as compared to the factory made ones. The noodles are so springy and flavourful from the chilli and pork lard too � it's only $4 for the upsized portion! Definitely a bowl I will crave when I'm at Berseh Food Centre!",5
"Was craving some desserts, and wanted something not too heavy. Cake Spade's strawberry tofu cheesecake ($7.90 per slice) hits the spot! It was smooth and creamy, best of all the tofu in the cheesecake made it more much lighter and less surfeiting.",4
"Bedok has a huge number of ice cream cafes, and dabao gelato is one of the newcomers. With the #burpplebeyond, we got the 1 for 1 medium cup ($7.80), which consist of at most 4 scoops. We got the 70% chocolate, vanilla citrus twist, coconut lychee and Earl Grey Lavender. The 70% chocolate is good; thick, bold and has fragrant chocolate flavours. The vanilla citrus twist is definitely very aromatic, with a slight sour twang which makes it really pleasant! The coconut lychee is basically coconut ice cream, not so much lychee. The Earl Grey Lavender is really way too strong, sadly it taste like perfume or soap bars.
We got the waffles ($4.80) to add on, and they are on the thicker and fluffier side! Not much crispy!",3
"Had a very enjoyable meal at Nangfa, as the food quality served was really beyond expectations. The Olive Fried Rice ($6) was really fragrant and had significant wok hei! The portion was huge too. The honey chicken ($6) was crispy and sweet, very enjoyable! The Pad Thai ($6) was not too dry and very fragrant, one of the better ones I've had! Honestly, I actually find the food here a little better than their neighbour �",4
"This is a hidden spot introduced by my friend, and is my go-to for yakitori now! The yakitori bento ($15.50) during weekday lunch provides the most value as at that price you get real quality skewers and a huge variety of ingredients. The star of the bento is definitely the skewers, as they were all so darn smoky and flavourful. The pork belly skewers are the best, due to its succulent meat! The rice is very good as well, especially the portion with the minced meat. Paired with the miso sauce provided, your every mouth of this bento will be filled with UMAMI flavours definitely!!!",5
"The Zi Char here is famous for their Milk Powder Pork Ribs ($10) and it is an interesting dish! The fried pork pieces are definitely flavourful, succulent and tender, and paired with the milky savoury topping, this is actually pretty addictive! Great to get if you are around! �",4
"One of the best Mee Hoon Kueh I've eaten? Indeed. At $3.50, this bowl has a generous portion of the usual ingredients, and what sets this part from the rest is the soup as well as the noodles. The noodles are handmade, and they are nicely thick and chewy. The soup wise is flavourful and definitely very heart warming. This is something I will crave if I am around the area!",5
"Tucked away in a corner is Drips Bakery Café, that are famous for their tarts. The fruit tart ($13.90) is bursting with different fruits, and the Yuzu Tart ($9.90) has tangy aromatic notes but the meringue is way too sweet to finish. Both tarts are abit too hard and we do find it rather expensive. Perhaps might be better to bring more people to share the tarts!",3
"Hidden in the neighbourhood is this famous old school dessert shop that has a huge variety of kuehs and other sweet treats to choose from. The Kueh Da Da has a strong coconut taste which was interesting, but what captured our hearts was the custard tart � it was so buttery and fragrant that we finished it before I remembered to take a picture � Their ondeh ondeh are also very good, as each piece are bursting with gula melaka �",4
"Some may not be used to the heavy porky flavour in this Pig Organ Soup ($4.50), but fret not, the ingredients in this bowl are really really fresh. Even the liver isn't too briney. Their chilli is perfectly vinegary too! Really good and comforting on a rainy weather. Another must try!",4
"Now this is a hokkien mee you know is going to be good before you eat it. For the middle portion of $5, the substantial portion of hokkien mee (is the drier version) are filled with load of seafood ingredients. The prawn broth is strong as well, and definitely goes very well with the savoury chilli! However, will be better if there was more wok hei. Definitely something to eat while you're around the area!",4
"May not seem like much, but this fishball noodle stall (汕源潮州粿条麵) really impressed me. I upsized my portion from $3 to $4, and I'm greeted by a huge bowl of chewy noodles that coated with an extremely satisfying chilli paste that has huge flavour from the pork lard. The soup also consist of a generous variety of ingredients that were very fresh. That includes pork liver slices that I don't usually eat, but theirs was not grainy but chewy and only has a mild liver taste. Definitely something I crave when I am around the area!",4
"Here first time for their mookata buffet ($22.80) and ended with a happy belly. The meats used are pretty fresh and well seasoned, my personal favourite is the pork belly because its just so juicy and tender with the char. I think it's pretty cheap and there's no GST and service charge as well!",4
"Here for the 2nd time, and I think this will be my go-to spot for desserts in jalan besar! The Yam Paste ($4.80) is as thick as ever and we both agreed that it's restaurant quality. The D24 Durian Mousse ($6) has a big dollop of durian flesh that is so fragrant together with the durian milk ice. The desserts are just abit too sweet. Definitely will be back here when I crave for Chinese desserts �",5
"Had such a wonderful time here in this restaurant. The service is really good, the food is delicious and the ambience is beautiful. The Chicken Confit ($19) was really tender, literally the fall off the bone kind. The chicken was seared well as well as you get the addictive crispy exterior. The vegetables are well charred, giving them the extra smoky flavour. All are soaked in this beautiful sauce made from chicken broth. The Sambal Angel Hair pasta ($19) had generous amount of seafood ingredients that were well seared too. Pasta portion is pretty huge!
The mocktails we got were very refreshing, especially the tropical fantasy ($9). Will definitely head here again! Thanks to #burpplebeyond for the 1 for 1 for the mains and drinks!",5
"Been to this cafe many times and the waffles are always on point. This time we decided to get the Smores Waffles ($15) and boy oh boy its a sinful yet satisfying dessert. Crispy fluffy waffles, rich and bold dark chocolate sorbet, melty marshmallows and thick chocolate sauce... Just heaven.",4
"Quite a nice place to chill and dine, with a good service. The waitresses don't hesitate to refill your glasses and clear your plates quickly... Perhaps abit too quickly � as for the food, it is pretty delightful!
Honey Glazed Pork Ribs ($26): very meaty, succulent and tender. Best with mustard sauce that you probably have to ask for.
Spanish Meaty Pork Ribs ($26): slightly drier and less meaty, but much smokier in flavour. Will prefer the honey glazed one!
Prime Ribeye ($26): although abit chewy, it's really flavourful and smoky. In terms of flavour I would think its a pretty good steak.
Iberico Secreto ($24): thinly sliced Iberico pork that is packed with flavour and smokiness from the charcoal grill. Really oily though! I think it will be great to share HAHA
Lamb Shank ($26): if you don't mind the taste of lamb you will love this one. Fall off the bone tender and full of flavour from the meat and spices used.
We ordered fries as sides as well and I must say the fried are really addictive! Wished that the portion of fries can be bigger though. Definitely enjoyed my dinner with 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond!",4
"Tried the XO Prawn Mee ($10) and absolutely loved it. The noodles were springy and the sauce that coats around it is full of the prawn broth flavour. The ebiko is a very good addition, further enhancing the seafood flavour of the dish. The prawns given were huge, plump and really fresh! We also had the dumplings platter, and my personal favourites were the fried pierogi and crab & prawn dumplings. Definitely will be back!",5
"Queued 1 hour for this, and it's worth the wait. We got the Seafood Tendon ($17.90) which had very fresh seafood ingredients like white fish, salmon, prawns and scallop. All of them were very well fried as the batter isn't too soggy. The portion is huge as well! The sides are not to be missed, as the mini chawamushi given was actually one of the best ones I've had so far. Will visit again!",5
"The moment I took the first bite, I knew this hits the list of the top 10 fried hokkien mee I've tried. Although there wasn't much wok hei, the flavour of the broth in the hokkien mee definitely shined. There was a strong prawn seafood flavour within, which makes it so darn addictive! The prawn and squid slices were fresh as well. I got the medium portion which was $5, and it was so huge! I thought I couldn't finish, but it was so good I almost licked the plate clean �",4
"Had this for takeaway. At first glance, I thought it was a pretty unassuming rice bowl, but oh boy they taught me a lesson to not judge a bowl by its cover. The Pork Chop Rice Bowl ($6.80) had a variety of healthy ingredients including brown rice and pickled vegetables. The pork chop was a stark contrast to the other ingredients as it was so darn flavourful and fatty; super addictive. The portion of pork chop is huge as well! It paired well with the healthy ingredients, making this dish not too surfeiting. Shout out to the onsen egg for completing the rice bowl! �",4
"Finally tried the all-popular fried rice that everyone has been talking about for some time. The XO fried rice with shrimp and added tobiko ($8.90) had a good wok hei, and the prawns were very plump and fresh. I can't really taste the XO though... Perhaps the egg fried rice version is good enough. The tobiko was a good addition, with the added seafood flavour to the dish! Gonna try the rice with pork chop the next time round, saw my friend ordered that and the pork chop was HUGE!",4
"Finally tried Scaled, but left with mixed reactions. One thing great is that their service is superb; they are all warm and friendly, and they explain the dishes to you one by one. The Prawn Dashi Aglio Olio ($24) had a good seafood flavour and the prawns given were very plump and fresh. The fried prawn heads were very fun to eat � we ordered another risotto but.. That was forgettable. The sides we ordered (calamari and mussels, $14 and $16 respectively) were pretty amazing though, as the seafood used were very very fresh. Not sure if its unfortunate, but we found that the sides and desserts were better than the mains. Maybe we will come back for the sides �",3
"First thing you probably will notice, is the HUGE portions provided by this cafe. The Deluxe Breakfast ($14.80) came with such a huge slab of fried chicken that was crispy, flavourful and definitely very succulent. The scrambled eggs were done very well as well; it was cooked just right with a good amount of creaminess. The Avocado and Egg Sourdough ($14.80) was very good as well, as the sourdough was well made. What a great find within the heartlands of Yishun! Definitely be back again �",4
"This is a cafe I was eyeing to go for some time, and I am glad the food is superb. The grilled cheese sandwich ($11 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has different cheeses all melted down to form a beautiful cheese filling that goes really well with the caramelised onions. The mushroom toast ($12 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is great as well, especially the sautéed mushrooms! Definitely a nice brunch place with good food. Will be back again!",4
"Saw a 20 people queue during lunch hour, and wanted to check out what's the hype. Turns out I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the lor mee with added fish ($4) and there's quite a load of ingredients hidden in this seemingly small bowl. Ingredients include fried fish, fried ngoh hiang and braised pork belly, but somehow I found the pork belly the most enticing due to its chunkiness and well braised tenderness. The fried ngoh hiang may be abit over fried, as it was a tad hard. The most satisfying is probably the broth, as it is SUPER thick and fragrant, unlike other lor mee I've had. A great find in the area!",4
"Once again, The Dark Gallery is my go-to to satisfy my chocolate cravings, and this time I went for the Ice Cream Bar ($9.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). We got the chocolate mint ice cream with the 88% dark chocolate, which was such a beautiful combination. One may think that it may be a chocolate overkill, but we were glad that the mint made it refreshing. The other we got 80% dark chocolate with the affrogato, and it was amazing as well, as the dark chocolate ice cream blended well with the espresso to form a rich mocha-like dessert. Definitely for chocolate lovers!",4
"Was very impressed with their pasta the other time, and hence decided to come back here again and once again, LINO has exceeded my expectations. The Mentaiko Chittara ($17.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was such a masterpiece. If you like mentaiko, this will be your go-to. The al dente pasta had a beautifully firm bite, and it came with a huge portion of pure mentaiko. Mixing everything up with its creamy sauce and a sous vide egg within, you get a beautiful creation that is extremely addictive.
The Truffle Mac and Cheese ($15.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was good as well, with a good amount of cheese and truffle within. Gonna come back again definitely!",5
"I have heard so much of their Mutton Biryani ($7), and seen too many snaking queues from this stall, and hence decided to try it out � I must say, its probably one of the best biryani I've had. The mountain of rice given was fluffy and really flavourful, superb with the curry given! The mutton was so beautifully tender and succulent as well � definitely a must try when you're in the area!",5
"Have always been a fan of Matchaya, as the soft serves ($6 for regular) are really of standard, perhaps similar standard to the ones I've had in Uji. Decided to get the houjicha today, and the roasted flavour comes through strong. Love the slight bitterness of the ice cream too �",5
"Really glad that I came hungry, as the food portion from this restaurant is huge. The B Supreme burger ($23 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) consists of a THICC juicy patty, with mushrooms, onions and truffle sauce. Definitely huge, meaty and flavourful. Comes with a heap of curly fries that one can never get enough from the small seasonal macs portions.
The Tempura Mentaiko Pasta ($21 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is rather unique, as the pasta sauce was shoyu based. Really flavourful, but perhaps too much to finish by myself. The tempura fish was meaty! Loved the meal!",4
"Will you look at the gloss and glistening fats from the char siew here? Bloody sinful and yet delicious. The wanton mee ($5) from Wen Kang Ji is slightly pricer for a reason, as it uses the ""bu jian tian"" portion to make char siew that makes it incredibly tender due to the huge amount of fats. The caramelised layer is extremely thick as well, you might even get some stuck in your teeth. The rest of wanton mee are great as well, including the noodles and soup! Bloody good with their sambal! A must get from this Hawker centre!",5
"Many from the west may know this tutu kueh shop and I love how friendly the auntie selling the tutu kueh was. We bought the chocolate tutu kueh ($4 for 5) and we striked a quick conversation with her, understanding the quality of the ingredients she uses. The chocolate she use is no chocolate rice, but are semi sweet chocolate chips instead. I love how the kuehs are chewy, and not so sweet!",4
"May look like a plain normal fish soup, but this is really on another level. The fish soup ($5/6) at Lin Ji Tang Yu Zhou has such a wonderful clear broth with the umami coming from the fried garlic pieces, with extremely fresh fish slices. This is really comforting on any day!",4
"One of the better Ang Ku Kueh's around, and they really don't disappoint. I got the peanut ($1), sweet bean ($1), coconut ($1), yam ($1.10) and of course, their premium durian flavour ($2.50). All flavours were good and I especially love the yam and durian flavours. I think the best part is the skin itself, as its super chewy and QQ �",4
"We wanted to try this for a long time, and I'm glad that we finally had a chance to. I was really pleasantly surprised by the food! The Beef Quesedillas ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was so darn good, with a good amount of melty cheese and pulled beef � it was our favourite! The Sudado (fish stew) ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) had a strong flavourful aromatic broth and the piece of barramundi was so fresh! The garlic rice add on was very good paired with their 3 kind of chilli sauce. Definitely will be back for more!",4
"Got the 2 person set at 58++, that comes with a stew, a BBQ hotplate and an appetiser (which I got the seafood pancake). The amount of food is definitely alot, and more than enough for 2 person. We got the kimchi stew which was good, and the seafood pancake, although thicker than usual, is still crispy on its sides. What stole the show was the marinated pork belly, as it was so darn flavourful and tender. Paired with the lettuce wrap, kimchi and ssamjang, it was really satisfying. In fact one of the best BBQ meats I've had!",5
"The Cacio E Pepe ($15 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) pasta is definitely the winning dish of all the pastas I've had in a long time. The fragrance of the black pepper, the saltiness of the cheese, together with the perfectly al dente malfade pasta really made the dish hella addictive. Really bloody good. So good that I probably come here again even without the 1 for 1.
The mixed mushroom pizza ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is good too!! Really cheesy and has that truffle aroma you're looking for. Even the crust is good!
Definitely will be back!",5
"Not the first time here, as the stews here are really wonderful and side dishes are very satisfying as well! The soft tofu stew with beef ($16) had a huge amount of ingredients and was so comforting. The jjajangmyeon ($15) is abit different from what I usually have, as the sauce is heavier on the bean taste and noodles are softer. Would prefer if the noodles are chewier though. Good nonetheless!",5
"Really hard to find much fault in this. The kwap chap set ($9 for 2 in this pic) boast really chewy kway (which is rare) with a good flavourful broth! The ingredients given were mostly large intestines, small intestines and stomach that were good! The intestines may have a slight odour, but it isn't upsetting. All were braised well! The chilli they made definitely completed the dish �",5
Now this is one of better oyster omelettes I've had. The oyster omelette ($5/8/10) had a very good char with a good amount of crispy bits that were really satisfying � the oysters given were so plump as well! Maybe the only downside is that it's slightly too salty HAHA,4
"I love the interior of the ice cream cafe, as it is really brightly lit with very pretty and minimalistic designs. The double scoop waffle ($16.50) was rather expensive, but I must say, the waffles are on point! It's crispy on the outside and really fluffy on the inside � the honey chrysanthemum with cocoa nibs and pistachio was good, but nothing special. However, still a good place to hang out definitely!",4
"Honestly, one of the best Guo Tie (Pan Fried Dumplings) ($6.50 for 10) I've eaten. Chewy dumpling skin, really juicy pork and chives filling and I absolutely love the crispy sides of the dumplings. Paired with the vinegar, ginger and chilli sauce, its really hard to get better than this.",5
"Looks like a sloppy mess, but I can guarantee that you will be wiping the gravy clean. The beef hor fun ($5) slices have a significant wok hei, and the sauce is garlicky enough. Totally love the beef slices as well! They were rather generous and they were very tender as well. Good to get when you're in the area!",4
"Haven't had a good burger in a long while, and I'm glad I had this. The Wagyu Burger ($25.90) had a soft patty that is nicely charred on its edges, with a good mild cheddar cheese that is melted into the patty. The truffle aioli, combined with the caramelised onions really added a new dimension to the burger, with the umami coming through strong. The fries were amazing too even after its cold!! No regrets having this sinful meal at all �",4
"Easties will know this place as a place that sells very good quality western food at really affordable prices. The Grilled Chicken ($5.90) came as a huge portion, and was well charred with a umami-tastic flavourful sauce. The signature herb potato and mushroom rice were the must-gets, as they contained much caramelised onions that were amazing � honestly, although I am a big eater, it's really difficult to finish this portion HAHA
Try their fried chicken cutlet ($5.90) as well! They were superb as they were very beautifully fried. Extremely crispy �
The only downside is the queue � went there at 5pm on Sun and got my food at 630pm HAHAHAHA",5
"Once again, wasn't expecting good food from a bar, but I was blown away by these 2 dishes.
The BBQ Pork Ribs ($25 added $2 for cheese fries 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was pretty tender, not fall off the bone tender, but was good enough. The sauce wasn't overpowering, and the meat was really flavourful! There's alot of meat in this one; definitely great for sharing! The cheese fries were great as well; crispy and fluffy.
The herb crusted fish ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was really good as well! The fish was so soft you probably don't need teeth to eat this. The dill from the cream sauce comes through very nicely, making the dish really flavourful! Definitely coming back hehe",4
"Honey Osmanthus Oolong Tea ($6.50 for L) - very refreshing and the flavour of the Osmanthus tea is smooth yet flavourful! 25% sugar is just nice. Definitely will be back to have this again.
Black Tea Latte ($5.80 for L) - honestly couldn't really taste the tea, perhaps it's because I added the Taro topping, which possibly overpowered the tea flavours.
I think it's okay if you use the Burpple Beyond! If not, it can be quite expensive for what you're getting �",3
"If you haven't had The Dark Gallery's ice cream, please do. The chocolate ice cream flavours here are very rich, decadent and bold, and you know they are made from good chocolate. The gelato texture is there is well; creamy and sticky. I personally love dark chocolate the most, and they have a good selection of single origin ones, and even 80% dark chocolate ice cream! � 2 scoops was $9.50 with added $1 for the waffle bowl. Definitely a dessert option when you're in town � sinful but beautiful.",5
"May not look like much, but this bowl of Gold Kolo Mee ($9.90) is packed with so much flavour and ingredients. The noodles are very springy, tossed in lard, making it really fragrant. Together with some savoury chilli they have on the side, the noodles are ultimate bombz! The other ingredients are all fresh as well. Definitely a good bowl of kolo mee! �",4
"This is one of the dish that seng kee is famous for: their mee sua with pig kidney and liver ($6.80). The soup is definitely a winner here, with its deep, bold herbal flavour. The mee sua is not too soft as well. The pig kidneys and liver are fresh and have little odour! Definitely a dish you can try when you are in the area �",4
"Back at Hay Gelato to try their interesting flavours and we left really impressed.
The Preserved Orange Peel flavour taste extremely like what it is made of, and yet with a refreshing touch. Really fragrant, totally recommend if you like a critus touch!
The Balsamic Strawberry may sound strange (there really is balsamic vinegar in there, you can't really taste it) but the strawberry is really fragrant and super refreshing. Another must get �
The damage was $8.40, felt like it was pretty worth it for the quality of ice cream I was getting �",5
"Prawn Paste Fried Chicken with Thai Sweet Sauce ($10.50) - the prawn paste chicken is indeed very well fried; the exterior is really crispy and the chicken within is juicy � the flavour of the prawn paste is well pronounced as well, making this really addictive! You can choose 2 sides to go with the chicken; the French fries and garden salad is okay, nothing special.
Tried the grilled chicken, but wasn't impressed though :( doesn't have the char taste :( however do go for the prawn paste chicken �",4
"One of the newer bars around, #WLJK offer a good range of meats, and definitely an extensive range of alcohol. I had the striploin ($30.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and it was a decent steak for its price. The steak had a good flavour and the char on it was on point. The only downside was that it was just slightly tough. The truffle fries at the side though, although the truffle flavours were abit too faint, the fries were so darn crispy and fluffy that they were super addictive �
They told us the cheesecake ($6) is popular and that it is must-try. They were right � the cheesecake was smooth, creamy and the cheese wasn't overpowering. One of the better cheesecakes I've had!!
The service is superb, and you can tell the waiters have the passion to serve.",4
"People might go Upper Thomson for cafe food, but chicken rice isn't that bad too! � The roasted chicken ($15 for half chicken) and steamed chicken ($15 for half chicken) were tender and flavourful. I especially loved the roasted chicken, as the skin is actually crispy � My friends loved the Mapo Tofu as well and it will make a great side to the chicken rice! Probably a good way to gain back the calories lost during the hike at Macritchie �",4
"A famous place for drinks, Tipsy Bird has an interesting take on local dishes. The XO Fried Carrot Cake ($12) has the wokhei you're looking for and paired with the sakura ebi and other condiments, this dish is packed with umami! The chilli power packed, be careful �
The Truffle Beef Hor Fun ($23) indeed has that truffle taste, but sadly the beef steak was tough and slightly overcooked. Probably a miss on this!
Other than that, it's definitely a good place for drinks �",4
"People say this may be the best Tau Sar Piah, and I dare say its the best I've eaten so far. The sweet or salty ones ($0.90 each) are beautifully flaky and crispy, with a flavourful and aromatic filling in the middle. One bite and you know its above the rest. Definitely worth a try!",4
"XL Chicken Cutlet Noodle ($5.50) - actually not bad of a bowl of noodles; springy noodles, good sauce, crispy and tender chicken cutlet, no complaints. Gotta get the lime chilli to accompany the chicken cutlet!",4
"Just beautiful. The MSW Durian Mousse ($9) although really quite expensive, but the durian flavour is STRONG in this one. Extremely rich and creamy, for durian lovers you will be happy with this � this small bowl is not enough �
The Orh Nee ($4.80) was smooth and creamy as well, with good fragrant yam flavours. Definitely a good bowl of orh nee, feels like I need more �
The mango pomelo sago ($4.80) is good as well, but definitely a bowl too rich to be finished by 1 person; They added a huge amount of cream. The mango pieces are pretty sweet though!
This place's been raving, as it is a newly opened dessert shop in Jalan Besar that opens till a surprising 3am!",5
"Indeed their White Lor Mee ($5) is as shiok as it looks, with a fragrant soup and a good amount of ingredients that will be beautiful during rainy days. The Fried Bee Hoon ($5) was too dry though, perhaps the Fried Mee Sua could have been a better choice.
The Fried Batang Fish ($10) though, although came quite sad looking with 3 pieces, but it turned out to be really addictive! �",4
"Food Barn offers a wide variety of sandwiches, burgers and other mains that are popular among the working population in the area. I tried the Beef BLT ($9.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and it tasted pretty great, with a good amount of beef and bacon, together with fresh ingredients. The bread itself is toasted and is on the harder side that many might appreciate. With some chips and coleslaw, this can be a great lunch! The smoked salmon sandwich which my friend had looked like it had a generous amount of smoked salmon � will try that next time!",4
"Most people living or working in tampines will know this famous mee hoon kueh stall, as they serve up really good dry mee hoon kueh ($4.80). The dough is firm and has a good bite and it pairs with the simple soy sauce and sesame oil very well. It gets even better if you mix the egg yolk in. The ingredients are pretty good as well; top up $2 and you get pretty fantastic fried cutlets!",4
"Heard quite abit about their shoyu ramen ($12.80) as well, and it did not disappoint. The soup was not too heavy and salty and yet quite fragrant. The char siu probably is the star of the meal here, as it has the perfect fat to meat ratio, and is very beautifully tender. Quite a thick slab as well. Good to go if you are around the area! Came with an hard boiled egg that I'm surprised that I could get another!",4
"Hidden in Tampines Greenridge (a clever location btw) is this Yocha cafe that sells bubble tea and ice cream desserts. I've had the single scoop waffles ($20.40 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the waffles were quite okay, and the ice cream flavours are not too bad as well. The chocolate honeycomb is thick (although abit too sweet) and the vanilla is aromatic. I will say abit better than average? The bubble tea there is not too bad too though. If you live around the area, this can be considered.",3
"May look like an ordinary fish soup ($4), but I can guarantee you that this is better than most fish soups out there. The soup is not only flavourful from the fish bones and bittergourd, but it gets its umami flavours from the fried garlic that is added in the soup. The fish slices are really super fresh, and has a good bite. Definitely worth a trip down for this.",4
"Tried their roasted pistachio ($5.20) and my oh my, it's one of the best pistachio ice cream I've had. Smooth and creamy, the pistachio flavour is strong in this one. I love how they add some crushed pistachios on top, to provide a different texture and intensify the flavour as well. Really really satisfying.",5
"Finally got the chance to try FATCAT, and I was left impressed by the ice cream flavours and waffles. The Osmanthus Honey had a strong tea flavour, while the Lychee one (can't remember the name) was incredibly refreshing! However, both were abit too sweet. The waffles were really crispy yet soft and fluffy within, really the kind of waffles I was looking for!",4
"One thing I appreciate from Sukiya's outlet at Vivocity is that the seating area is HUGE, giving you loads of space to place the food ingredients you will have � The ingredients themselves are all pretty fresh as well. Service is pretty darn good here as well! Perhaps the flaw was that the soup base was just alright, nothing fancy. With the 30% discount from burpple beyond, it cost about $25.75 all-in per pax, including the free flow drinks and ice cream.",4
"Located in a humble stall in Holland Drive, is Supreme Xiao Long Bao, that serves up pretty authentic Chinese dishes. The zhajiangmian, or black bean noodles ($3.50) may come in a relatively small portion, but the quality is really good. The noodles are firm and chewy, and the sauce has that salty umami kick that makes the noodles really addictive. The xiao long bao ($4.50 for 6) is pretty good as well. The fried dumplings ($4 for 8) is really satisfying as well, as it is pretty filled with loads of ingredients and has the crust I was looking for. Definitely a good find!",4
"Ordering from this stall is a pleasant experience, as you will be greeted by the 2 aunties that were very friendly and courteous. The Kway Chap here is a popular one, and pretty cheap as well. The Kway itself were not soggy or overcooked at all, something I really appreciated as I could hold the whole piece without it breaking apart immediately. The portion given was pretty sizable and the pork intestines were well cleaned! 4 pax amounted to $26 with the addition of duck meat.",5
"I'm glad to see that the quality of the food here has improved over the years, and this Signature Chirashi Don ($29.90 burpple set 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is much better than the one I had when they first opened. Filled with generous amounts of pretty fresh ingredients like salmon, tuna, swordfish and octopus, the bowl was very flavourful and pretty satisfying. Maybe 1 downside will be that the vinegar in the rice may be abit too excessive, making the rice abit too sour for my liking.
I love the miso soup that comes with the Burpple set too, as it is cooked with seafood ingredients, making the soup extra flavourful�",4
"Wanted to try this for the longest time, and I'm glad that I did. The Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict ($14) was just amazing, with fresh ingredients used. The eggs were well poached, the stewed pulled pork was really flavourful and tender and the brioche bread �� bread yard is known for their breads and this really didn't disappoint. The brioche bread was soft and it was perfect as it soaked up all the egg yolk and other sauces �� what a good brunch especially if you work around the area!",5
"One of the popular tendon restaurants around; Tenjin serves pretty good quality tendon bowl, and the Jo Bowl ($14.80) did not disappoint. The ingredients are very really fresh and not too greasy, especially the prawn tempura. Probably one of the best bowls of tendon around in Singapore.
The truffle chawanmushi ($4) was a good appetiser as well, with a strong truffle umami taste.",4
"Now I really wasn't expecting much of food from a bar, but Tipsy Penguin gave me a wonderful surprise. The Gyudon Beef Bowl ($16) was really mind-blowing; the beef slices itself, although not many were given, but they had such a good smoky char flavour and they were so tender as well. The mushrooms were very beautifully sautéed, with such a strong umami flavour � definitely will be back again!",4
"Always been a fan of the ice cream at their original outlet at Tampines, and their outlet here at Race Course Road don't disappoint as well. Their waffles ($6) are beautifully chewy with a slight crunch, and definitely pairs well with their ice cream, which is the sticky gelato type, and their flavours are really good � we got the Earl Grey and Brownie and Cream ($4.50 each) which were very pleasant, especially the Earl Grey as it was smooth and not too overpowering �",5
"Original Single Cheeseburger Set ($13.50): Probably what you call a good quality fast-food burger, that is juicy but not too greasy at the same time. I really enjoyed the fresh greens in the burger itself that makes the burger really much less surfeiting. The skinny fries were pretty good as well, abit better than the usual Macs fries we are familiar with!",4
"Toby's Estate's food is really pretty amazing, with fresh brioche bread and ingredients that make the breakfast pretty wholesome. The Eggs Benedict Brooklyn Style ($21.50) has good stewed beef that is tender and flavourful. The Brekkie of Champions has a good variety of ingredients and all were very well done. Best is probably the tomatoes, as it was super juicy. We tried the coffee here as well, but sadly they really weren't good �",4
"The dark chocolate ice cream here is rich and smooth, but the other flavours doesn't impress � The salted caramel brownie is way too salty and the toasted marshmallow flavour gives a weird aftertaste that my friends rejected after a mouthful. Maybe the upside from this place is that the portion of ice cream is indeed pretty big!!",3
"Yes I know, it may look like just any other Hawker centre coffee you might get, but trust me, this is different. Seletar Coffee in Whampoa Food Centre makes their coffee extremely thick or ""gao"", and the coffee the owner uses is really fragrant and is of low acidity. Best of all, this cup of kopi peng is only $1. Really a must get for people staying or working around the area!",4
"Kim's Family pride themselves for giving a huge variety of side dishes, or panchan, and that is really something I enjoyed snacking on while waiting for the food to come. While I was surprised that the chicken bulgogi ($25) was not cooked on the grill at our table, it was still good as the chicken was tender, and the sauce... Oh my its perfect with rice; sweet, savoury and just the right amount of spice. The soondubu hotpot ($40) was huge, and it came with a variety of seafood ingredients including prawns, octopus, clams, mussels and of course, pork belly. The soup was fantastic, but maybe the only gripe I had was that the mussels really aren't that fresh.",4
"This is what one will call a hidden spot, as this Chinese zichar restaurant is located on the 6th floor of an industrial building; probably a place where people won't think of coming of having good food. The zichar dishes are decent and not too expensive, but what that impressed me was their fish head steamboat ($35/45/55). We had the small one with red grouper, and it came with generous amount of fish meat that extremely fresh and meaty. This probably explains why the soup is so naturally flavourful and addictive! Will be back definitely �",4
"This is my go-to place for Thai food, because the food here really doesn't disappoint. The Olive Fried Rice ($6) had a STRONG wok hey flavour that I was looking for, and it is flavourful. The Tom Yum Goong is a must get as well, as the soup is thick, spicy and contains much seafood ingredients. I love how the interior of the restaurant is made very spacious as well!",4
"Don Dae Bak uses charcoal to grill the meats, and some were pretty good! The pork belly slices are fresh not frozen, and the quality is actually pretty decent. The weekday buffet goes for $27.90 per pax and one of the best part is actually the free flow omelette that you can get and with the grill, it is possible to make it soft and fluffy � most decent Korean BBQ places tend to be rather pricey, hence this is a good recommendation if you are looking for something in the middle ground �",4
"Back at Perch once again, and the food served here remains as good or if not better. The Australian Pork Jowl ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is absolutely stunning, with wonderfully tender and succulent pieces of pork jowl that goes so well with the pickled cabbage below. Really can't find fault in this beautifully executed dish. Probably a must get here.
The Steamed Baby Seabass with Lemongrass Broth ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) reminds me of Tom Yum Goong actually, but the ingredients used are fantastic. Hidden within the soup is a meaty piece of seabass that is fresh.
Although somewhat expensive without burpple beyond, but you are guaranteed a wonderful meal, service and experience. Definitely will be back again.",4
"Was wondering what's with the hype with this, and can finally understand why � the original coconut shake ($4.40) is really refreshing, with little bits of coconut flesh all blended together. I think 0% sugar has the perfect sweetness level, perhaps for not so sweet tooth people like me!",4
"Most will love a hearty Korean meal, and I'm glad that I'm able to get some quality ones in the east from the restaurant. The soondubu (soft tofu) stew ($13.90) is really packed with ingredients, and boast a very full bodied soup and will definitely warm your heart. With 5 quality side dishes that can be refilled, you are guaranteed a full hearty meal!",4
"Been ages since I went to this burger place, and the quality of the food and service is still high or even better. We had the Hans Im Gluck set ($24 + $4 for alcoholic drink) and the Henne set ($23 + $4 for alcoholic drink) and they were superb � the burgers are really customizable, and don't expect the burgers to be sinfully juicy; they are known for their natural healthy tasting burgers and I must say the ingredients used are really fantastic. Furthermore, the portion given is ENORMOUS �
I enjoyed the cocktails as well, they were huge, I think 3 small cocktail glasses worth? You can taste the alcohol so you know they do put some in it ☺️ the set comes with a hot drink to end your meal right �
The service is absolutely amazing, with the waiters occasionally checking if we are okay with our food, and asking if we need anything else � will definitely be back again!",5
"Serangoon Garden Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee - this is the kind of wet hokkien mee that you are looking for. The $4 portion was pretty substantial, and the broth used to make the dish is definitely flavourful!
Bedok 511 Chicken Wings - this is one stall not to be missed as the chicken wings ($1.40 each) are crispy on the edges, and yet smoky. The chicken and pork satay ($0.70 each) are really good as well, as they were tender, succulent and well marinated. Actually better than the ones I've had at Bedok 85!",4
"Honestly, one of the best bowls of pig organ soup I've had so far. The Signature Pig's Organ Soup ($4.20) had a wonderful variety of ingredients, and all of them are really fresh. The soup is really good as well, with a deep bold yet refreshing flavour that is had to forget. I always believe that chilli is important for this dish as well, and the one from this restaurant did not disappoint. The chilli was perfectly sour and spicy at the same time, alleviating the dish to a new level!",5
"Many will know this from the Food King series, and it did not disappoint. The Seafood Pao Fan had a very strong stock, that was flavourful from all the seafood that was simmering in it. The clams, prawns and fish given were very fresh as well! However, it was really way too flavourful to finish the bowl; although I was pleasantly surprised by the first mouthful, it was difficult to wipe the bowl clean.",4
"Located in a pretty secluded corner, this frog porridge restaurant is popular to many, and I can understand why. The claypot frog legs (3 for $16) was pretty meaty and had a good strong flavour from dried chilli sauce. Paired with porridge, this is one hearty meal. They have grilled stingray ($16 for medium portion) as well, and it's pretty sizeable. We got the garlic version of it, which is uncommoy seen � Although the umami from the garlic comes through, we still preferred the dish prepared with sambal. We all agreed that this place is better than the one at geylang �",4
"Sometimes you just want a good simple bowl of handmade noodles, and this is one to go for when you're around the area. For this Dumplings Mee Hoon Kueh ($3.50) the soup itself is probably the best part, and they use fish bones to get that flavourful broth. The kueh itself is fantastic, as it has a good bite and you don't really taste the dough. Dumplings itself has a good bite, and has pretty sizable amount of filling!",4
"Sorry for the bad photos, but this Korean BBQ place is really on quite another level. The spicy chicken thigh ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) , although not a huge portion, but was really tender and flavourful, with the smoky char from the grill. The pork belly kimchi stew ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was pretty good as well, especially their pork belly slices, which they are known for. The pork belly slices really taste a notch above the rest, and I will be back for it some day. Maybe the downside is that I had to pay $5 for the ramen add-on � but the best part is that the staff service is excellent and they will cook all meats for you �",4
"This humble bakery in Lavender is known to many for their freshly made breads costing $1.70-2 each, and they do not disappoint.
Their bread are surprisingly extremely soft to the touch, and yet chewy as munch into them. They used the right of amount of filling as well, making sure not to take away their best selling point, which is the bread itself. Be sure to get one while you're round the area!",5
"Haven't been back here in ages, and they surprised me with their improvement of dishes here. The Baked Chicken with Truffle Mushroom Sauce ($15.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was very well executed. Though there wasnt much truffle taste in the sauce, it was enough flavour from the mushrooms to make it addictive. The chicken was quite a large piece, and was tender. Best part was that the skin was crispy on its edges � The truffle fries was crispy and fluffy, glad to have that truffle hint there.
I tried my friend's Pan Seared Barramundi, and my oh my its phenomenal. Got to have that next time.
Best of all, all proceeds go to charity and hence your meal will be for a good cause �",4
"Finally tried these immensely popular bagels, and well, it's pretty darn good. The Red Dead ($16) contains smoked beef brisket, smoked sausages and some kind of a slaw within. There is a hell lot of meat in this, and all were seasoned well. The briskets were pretty tender though slight dry, but the smoked sausages takes the show. This may look small, but its really dense and super filling. The downside will be that it's really too overpriced...",4
"I can safely say, this is one of the best seafood mee sua ($5) I've had. The sauce is thick and incredibly smoky, and so darn flavourful from the seafood stock that is used to make the dish. The noodles were also nicely springy, and the portion was pretty generous. They gave quite a few clams and a prawn and they were all very fresh!",5
"This is my go-to place for my ramen cravings, as its ramen quality has been consistently high even after so many years. This Autumn theme Ramen ($12.90) is one of the best among all Keisuke outlets. The umami from both the pork and bonito broth blends so well together, forming this thick flavour packed broth that left me no choice but to finish the bowl clean!
I love the free hard-boiled eggs and bean sprouts concept as well and they are so good together with the broth �",5
"This ramen shop specialises in their Black Garlic Ramen, and its pretty satisfying. The Black Garlic Tonkutsu Ramen ($10.80/12) was smoky, the soup was thick enough and the black garlic oil gave it extra umami flavour. Definitely an option to consider while you're in town!",4
"Cicada, one of the new restaurants that popped up right smack in Clarke Quay boasts a cozy atmosphere and serves up amazing dishes. The Char-Grilled Spiced French Chicken ($30 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) boasts a wide variety of ingredients cooked with a grilled chicken that is tender and packed with flavour. The miso cod capellini ($30 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is also unforgettable as the cod itself is very well executed. As for the mini tacos, well... I would give that a miss.",4
"If you are looking for good beers liquors but still want your local zi-char, this is one place to go. This place sells rather affordable zi-char with many different kinds of alcohol to choose from. I love their beer selections ($8.80 - $11.80) and their highball and spirit concoctions are pretty affordable as well! The atmosphere is pretty chill as well, great for chill drinks with friends �",4
"This Char Siew Chee Chong Fun ($4) is famous in Pek Kio Market, and I can see why. The Chee Chong Fun itself is not soggy at all, and stayed pretty solid while soaked in the sauce. They put quite abit of char siew into the Chee Chong Fun, that gave it really alot of flavour. This is definitely a notch above the rest, but me and my friends do find it abit too sweet.",4
"Was actually quite surprised to find mee kia available at a prawn mee stall and decided to give it a try. I got the $3 portion and it was pretty substantial. The noodles were nice and springy and prawns were very fresh! The soup is definitely an important element, and it was good, with abundant flavour coming from the prawn heads and pork ribs that were used to make the broth.",4
"This is a recently opened ice cream parlour in Lau Pa Sat, and I must say I'm really impressed by the quality of ice cream here. We got the Deep Dark Chocolate and Lychee Raspberry ($4.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and both were extremely good. The chocolate was velvet smooth and was thick as well, and tasted like 60% cocoa chocolate! The Lychee Raspberry was a pleasant surprise, as it was super refreshing! Also, the scoop given is pretty huge as well. Definitely a great dessert option after a satay meal in Lau Pa Sat �",4
"One of my go-to places in tampines: if you are looking for some good Chinese soup noodles, this place got you covered. From tomato based soups to spicy sour soups, they indeed satisfied my cravings on a rainy day. If you don't fancy dry noodles, you can get the Mushroom Braised Beef Shank Dry Noodle ($9.90) which has that deep umami flavour from the mushroom paste that coated the handmade noodles well. Seems like they are having their 1 for 1 ala-carte bowls promotion for some time!",4
"Was introduced to my first Vegetarian Biryani ($9.50), and was so pleasantly surprised! The Biryani included a variety of side dishes and the best was the eggplant one, that was so flavourful and aromatic. The rice was very fluffy as well, good enough to eat on its own. Best of all, it came with 2 papadum ��",4
"DISCLAIMER: I couldn't find the location tag of this stall on Burpple, but it is called Xiong Kee Roast Meat, located at 87 Whampoa Drive.
Now this is one roast meat stall you should never miss. The roasted pork here is fabulous, with extremely crispy skin and succulent meat. The roasted duck has a slight crispy skin, with really oily, tender meat that has that slight herbal taste. Both meats are probably one of the best I've had so far. 2 meats for 2 people is only $10! This stall has set the bar real high.",4
"The sashimi saba shioyaki set ($27.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is way too expensive for its original price, but I must say the food served was good. The saba fish was nicely grilled, perfectly seasoned and incredibly juicy; the sashimi was fresh. However, I didn't like the atmosphere and setting though. Not the kind of dining setting I was looking out for.",3
"Most people working in the area will know this hidden jem, and this is one really good find indeed. The Sliced Fish Soup ($4.50) is quite different from the rest, as the soup is so much more flavourful than the rest, probably due to the deep fried omelette that is added to the soup. The fish slices given were very fresh as well. Do get the fermented beans at the side for that umami kick!",4
"Venchi boasts a good sticky ice cream texture, with flavours that aren't too heavy. I got the cappuccino and salted toffee flavours in the regular cup ($10 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and they taste really smooth. The cappuccino can't go wrong, and the salted toffee had the right amount of saltiness to its deep caramel flavour. However, for the full price, this will be expensive �",4
"Have heard about their quality of food served, and went to check it out. My oh my, this Ribeye steak ($32 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is probably one of the best ones I've had at its price. Nicely seasoned, incredibly tender. There were some portion of fat in there, and although sinful, they melted instantly in my mouth. The fries were good as well; love it when they have the skin on.",5
"Yes I know, plain old prata. But the prata from this place has the doughy chewy texture that I love, and the slightly crispy crust that is indeed satisfying. Paired with curry, this is my go-to supper anytime �",4
"I know, this place is famous for their wanton mee, but I found a dish better than that or their claypot rice. Their hor fun ($12/15) is really quite expensive for their portion but it's probably one of the best ones I've had. Good amount of wok hei, generous amount of ingredients and perfect consistency of sauce to mop it all up. This is one dish I find myself trying to clear up the scrapes instinctively.
Eng's Wanton Mee and Traditional Claypot Rice",4
"Probably not difficult to miss this place, due to its brightly lit shop as well as its popularity. This place specialises in Chinese desserts, and they taste much more decadent than other places I've had. The Taro Ball with grass jelly ($3.50) boasts good quality milk, with very smooth tasting grass jelly.
The mango sago pomelo ($4) is another classic Chinese dessert, and it isn't too sweet, compared to other dessert shops that I visited. Really good ambience to have a good quality time!",4
"This humble little shop offers amazing dishes, including the all famous Lechón, that is one of the better ones I've had. The crispy skin to the melty fat to the tender meat; this one you can eat on its own. The sisig was very much delicious as well, as the egg binded the different pork cuts well, creating a deep flavour and texture profile. To accompany these strong tasting dishes, the sinigang soup is a must-have, as its tangy flavours will refresh your taste buds. All dishes were about $14 for medium size. Loved the owners for their hospitality as well. Very homely indeed!",5
"The beef noodles here ($9.90/11.90) is not the best I've had, but still hits the spot for the recent rainy weather. The soup is fragrant and the beef slices are tender. The mutton skewers ($3.50 per stick) are amazing, as the charred flavours and aromatic spices are strong, but really rather expensive though.",4
"Absolutely love the old school vibes here, and the ice cream ($5 for medium cup 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) texture is fantastic. With a sticky gelato texture, the chocolate sorbet is probably one of the best hits here. They definitely put alot of chocolate into this. Because it's a sorbet, it does not contain milk and thus not too heavy at all! Super addictive!",4
"May look like regular fishball noodles, but this is a notch above. The fishball and meatballs are handmade, and they contain little or no flour in them, creating a different meaty texture, with a great flavour. The noodles were springy and beware, the chilli packs a punch! It's my go-to whenever I'm here �
Yong Hwa Delights (Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre)
Fishball noodles ($3/4)",4
"Banger and Mash ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) I must say, I wasn't expecting much of the food from a bar but this is really one of the better I've had. Really creamy and smooth mashed potatoes with peppery flavourful sauce, juicy sausages and crispy onion rings. The vibes of the place is fantastic, perfect for a chill night with friends, or even a date �",4
"May look like a normal plate of chicken with rice, but contains one of the best Prawn Paste Chicken I've eaten. The Prawn Paste Chicken Rice ($5.80) from this coffee shop has a variety of ingredients, and the prawn paste chicken was so crispy and juicy, yet fragrant at the same time. Really appreciated the bite sized portions! The chilli given is to die for as well, as it is garlic-packed. Great if you are around in the area!",4
"Newly opened in August 2020, this place has all the elements that makes a good dining experience. The Carne Rossa Pizza ($28 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) boasts a beautiful thin yet chewy pizza dough, and is topped with a good amount of meats and cheese. The quality of the pizza is insane I must say; probably one of best ones I've had in Singapore.
If you haven't tried Calzone before, the owner will describe it to you humorously, saying its like a Italian curry puff. True enough, the Classic New York ($26 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) pizza ingredients are wrapped in a pizza dough and baked, and this produces a crispy crust, with really satisfying melty cheese oozing from within.
You can easily tell the owner serves the dishes with his heart, making the dining experience superb. Also, if you are lucky you are able to get the window seats, facing the Singapore River. Definitely will be back for this, with or without Beyond.",4
"With the rainy season here, I started craving for meals with hot soups, and this hits the spot. The Sliced Fish Bee Hoon ($4.30) from this coffeeshop boasts THICC slices of fish that were so fresh and a very comforting soup that is cloudy from hours of boiling fish bones. Paired with their chilli, this is one dish that will warm not only your belly, but your heart as well �",5
"If you are looking for desserts after a meal at bedok 85 Market, this will hit the spot. The Tiramisu and Earl Grey ice cream ($4.5/5 each) we got were thick and decadent especially the Earl Grey, which was so aromatic. Definitely one of the best Earl Grey ice cream I've had. Paired with their fluffy waffles, this place will definitely satisfy your cravings!",4
"If you like your food drenched in sauces, perhaps this is a place for you. The Korean fried chicken ($29.90 for 12 pcs) can come original, or you can choose a myriad of sauces to pair them with. We got the garlic dakgangjeong and the jjamppong mayo, which were both good in their own ways. The garlic dakgangjeong has the savoury and vinegary kick, while the jjamppong has a straight up spicy kick.
The Cheesy Maru Oppa pizza ($16.90 for 9 inch) was satisfying as well, and they were generous with the sauces on the pizza. Had a pretty full meal!
Another good news: they are trying to get their halal certification!",4
"Just phenomenal. We ordered a variety of skewers (1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) including pork, beef and mushrooms. The pork belly skewers were so darn juicy and the beef skewers were very tender. Both were flavoured well with Chinese 5-spice! The mushroom skewers were so good as well, as they were grilled till they have a crispy crust.
The stir fried pork and kimchi ($7.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was so good as well, as the kimchi really provided the refreshing taste I was looking for from all the meats.
To top it off, the Kirin frozen beer ($15) was just FANTASTIC because the frozen beer foam makes this beer like a slushie, perfect thirst quencher indeed.",5
Came here for a random weekday lunch and left feeling really satisfied! The sanuki beef egg udon ($16.70 with a set of gyoza and drink 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was umami-tastic and the noodles were chewy. There were a good amount of tender beef slices as well! Really value for money with the Burpple Beyond ���,4
"Finally, I've found another ice cream cafe that I am willing to travel from the East for. We got the Dark Chocolate, Earl Grey, Salted Caramel and Yuzu Raspberry flavours and we had zero regrets.
Dark Chocolate: Thick and decadent. This should be the standard for dark chocolate ice cream really.
Earl Grey: Light but very aromatic. The Earl Grey is strong in this one �
Yuzu Raspberry: If you like sour taste profile, this is your gem. The sourness hits you straight, but you know they used alot of fruits in this.
Salted Caramel: Now this is the star of the show. Thick, just slight salty but not too sweet, and the roasted flavour goes deep. This is extremely addictive.
Paid $20.80 total including 1 for 1 #burpplebeyond for the classic waffles.",4
"Wanted to explore Toa Payoh, and I'm glad I went to this Hawker centre. This place is filled with stalls that are well known by the people staying in the area, including this oyster omelette from Tian Tian Fa ($4/6/8). This is a drier version as compared to other stalls and many will appreciate the numerous crispy bits that go so well with the juicy plump oysters.
The curry rice ($3.70 for 2 meat 1 veg) from Toa Payoh Scissors Cut Curry Rice also satisfied my cravings for that, due to its thick flavourful curry sauce. I do wish their chicken cutlet is crispy though.",4
"The Pig Organ Soup ($5.10 with yam rice) here boasts a huge variety of ingredients, from loads of spine meat, to well cooked portions of liver. The soup here is indeed refreshing, as it isn't too salty, and it is packed with flavour from the salted vegetables. All ingredients go so well with the vinegar chilli. Will be back for more �",4
"Ever seen a plate of char kway teow ($4/5) so green? �� Besides the amount of green veggie they gave (which I greatly appreciated), the char kway teow was so flavourful, with a good amount of wok hei. It came with 2 plump prawns and quite a handful of cockles. Probably one of the best plate of char kway teow I've had �",5
"This Keong Saik branch has a wide variety of vegan options, including the 2° Matcha and Houjicha ice cream scoop ($6.80 each) that we got. Both were presented in very aesthetic bowls, that definitely matches the already incredibly aesthetic design of the ambience.
Both scoops taste really decadent; you know they use quality Japanese green tea. I liked the Houjicha one more, due to the roasted flavour that really gave the ice cream a whole dimension of flavours.
A great place for dates or a chill night with your friends definitely ☺️",4
"This restaurant has a 100% vegetarian menu, and you can simply make the dishes vegan without any additional cost by putting a simple tick in the order slip.
We ordered the laksa baked pasta ($18.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the truffle wild mushroom pizza ($20.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and they were both really flavourful! I had a strong impression of the pizza, as the crispy thin crust, together with the earthy flavours really gave huge points to the dish. Definitely will be back!!",4
"This cafe is definitely well known in the east, serving up delicious all day brunches. The Pulled Pork on Toast (I can't remember the real name) ($13.90) came with generous portions of pulled pork, and I really appreciated the perfectly poached eggs on the toast � The Salmon Scramble ($14.50) is on another level though; the pesto scrambled eggs, together with the smoked salmon and naan was the perfect pairing!
Service is really fast and wonderful here. Great for good quality time here with your loved ones ☺️",4
"Messy, but extremely satisfying. The standard duck rice ($4) comes with rather substantial portion of duck meat and a braised egg and I must say: the quality is excellent. All ingredients including the rice has a strong braised flavour. One of their specialty is their chilli, which lifts the dish to a whole new dimension.
They did not neglect the soup as well, as the herbal notes truly made the experience refreshing as well.",4
"The Tori Chasu Ramen boast a thick chicken broth, with a very flavourful chicken chasiu. Even the black fungus was satisfyingly crunchy. The cheesy gyoza ($6.80 for 4 pieces) was rather expensive as it was so small, but at least it was decent. Good to see that this is a halal-certified restaurant as well!",4
"Many working around the area may recognise this restaurant, due to its quality dishes. I must say, the Sliced Fish Bittergourd Soup (~$8, comes with a free drink) is really good, as you can taste that the soup indeed has natural ingredients, making it really refreshing and addictive. The fish slices were extremely fresh I must say, but they did not give many pieces sadly �",4
"After trying this place out a couple of times, I must say the food is really pretty satisfying, especially with the #burpplebeyond.
The tomato based and pumpkin based soup are indeed very strong on their individual notes. You have to LOVE tomato or pumpkin to really enjoy them.
The hot and spicy soup bases are pretty safe. The sichuan peppercorn aroma from the Sea Bass and Sichuan Pickles Noodle ($14.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) isn't too strong, and the sourness is just right. It came with quite many pieces of seabass as well.
If all doesn't work, the Marinated Beef Shank Dry Noodle ($11.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) would work as the umami coming from the mushroom sauce will definitely keep you addicted.
Service is wonderful as well! Definitely be back for more ��",4
"Got this famous kolo mee to-go, and really this picture does not do justice to how good this plate is. Their signature sarawak kolo mee ($4.50/5/6) has a large amount of really springy noodles coated with some fragrant chilli sauce that packs a punch. The pork ribs were very well braised and were very tender.
I would suggest getting the $5 portion for the extra 1-2 chunks of meat, if not the $4.50 portion is definitely good enough. Prepare to queue though, average waiting time is about 30 mins!",4
"Located at Bishan 514A (really near the bus interchange) lies Kimly Seafood which is very well known among the people living around the area. We got a couple of dishes including the set meals. The BBQ Pork Ribs set ($5.50) that comes with 4 rather succulent and flavourful pork ribs, also included an egg and of course rice. The best was the salted vegetable seafood soup ($12) that we ordered that came with generous amounts of fresh fish, squid and prawns. The soup was really flavourful too!
I can see why it's so popular, as the food is good and the price is reasonable; 4 set meals and 3 medium sized dishes amounted to a total of 48 for 4.",4
"This was an impromptu visit, and I must say I was relatively impressed by the food here. Using the Burpple Beyond $20 Mains Set, we got a cheeseburger and a pan seared salmon. The set also came with a free side, which we got a pretty huge basket of truffle fries. The fries were average, but the burger was pretty good! The patty was juicy and flavourful, but my only gripe was that the BBQ sauce they added was too overpowering.
The salmon was not too bad; fresh and nicely seasoned, but abit overcooked.
Honestly worth it with the Burpple Beyond, but for the full price, maybe not.
Love the interior of the cafe though! Definitely a place to sit and chill for a long time!",4
"As I missed the pork backbone soup back in South Korea, I'm glad that this is one of the very few places that have it in Singapore. The ppyeohae jangguk ($18) may be pricey, but it was a huge portion. The taste of the soup may be slightly diluted as compared to the ones I've had in South Korea, but it is still very hearty nevertheless. The panchan provided are free flow, and they are also very tasty. A rather good place to settle your Korean food cravings!",4
"In a quiet corner of Marina Square lies this rather cosy restaurant and don't expect really good pastas or pizzas here; the food here is okay, but with #burpplebeyond it's really pretty worth it. The Parma Di Rucola Pizza ($17.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has a good thin crust, with a basic tomato sauce, but the parma ham elevates the dish a little.
The Tortellini Truffle ($18.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has really LOADS and LOADS of mushroom packed in the cream sauce, and the cheese filled tortellini has a nice bite to it. Overall a pretty surfeiting dish but nice to share.
Come here for a no-frills lunch or dinner!",3
"May look like some regular mee hoon kueh, but this bowl with sliced fish ($4/5/6) is definitely a slight notch above the rest. The soup is pretty refreshing, and the fish slices were very fresh. Their chilli is the bomb, as it is extremely spicy yet fragrant, further elevating this bowl of hearty goodness. Best for a rainy day. Do check it out if you are around the area!",4
"Heard that this stall is famous and decided to give it a try. Compared to the other famous brands that I've tried, I must say this is a pretty worth it place to go to if you're around the area, as for just $6, you get 3 thick slabs of pork ribs that are really tender. You don't even need much sauce to go with the meat! However, the soup isn't too good.
They have an interesting fried porridge ($5) that is probably one of a kind as they basically light up the porridge in flames in the wok to give it the distinct smoky taste. This is probably not for everyone, but I do find it rather flavourful.
The fried pork intestines ($6) came in a disappointing portion, but its really done well. I love how it's crispy and flavourful, but doesn't have too much of the odour.",4
"Now this is a really good place to satisfy your oyster omelette cravings.
The fried oyster ($4/6/8/10) is for people that love their omelette on a drier side. The omelette is extremely fragrant and not too dry, but you still get your crispy bits fix. Paired with their juicy oysters, you're definitely in for a treat.
The oyster omelette ($6/8/10/12) is a starchier and wetter version of the omelette, and it comes drenched with generous amount of seafood chilli sauce. This is my personal favourite, due to the heavier seafood taste and its uniqueness in its hearty flavour. This style is a rare find in Singapore!
Their carrot cake ($3/4/5) is also worth a mention as the carrot cake has the smoky flavour incorporated in it. Totally love how the black version has caramelised bits!
This stall is a must try if you are in Circuit Road Food Centre!!! �",5
"You know you are near bedok 85 when you smell the smoke coming out from the many grill stalls in the Hawker centre. Chong Pang Huat is one of the cheaper stalls there selling satay and chicken wings, and that does not stop them from serving up quality food. The chicken/pork satay (60c each) have nice charred bits and were really succulent, especially the chicken one!
The chicken wings ($1.30 each) are also really smoky and is seasoned just right. I love how it isn't too sweet as well. Will definitely be back for more �",4
"Looks really messy, but if you love cheese and Japanese curry, this will taste heavenly to you. The Aburi Cheese Black Curry Rice with Beef Hamburg ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) is extremely hearty, with their new Hakata black curry that is really fragrant. The amount of cheese is definitely generous. The hamburg, hidden underneath the bed of melted cheese, was really tender and flavourful as well. Definitely a place to recommend for Japanese curry rice!",4
"Have heard alot about this restaurant, and decided to give it a try under the #burpplebeyond set ($80+ for 2 pax). I was delighted by the variety of dishes that were served under the set menu and was mostly impressed.
One of the 4 sharing appetisers is the truffle capellini and it has a very strong truffle flavour paired with fresh mushrooms. The lettuce with tonnato dip was extremely appetising as well, due to the dip's strong umami flavours. The sourdough with duck rillettes caught my attention as well but it was abit too dry.
You can say that the chicken confit is like a western take on our chicken rice, and it is well done indeed. The risotto soaked up a good amount of chicken stock, and the chicken confit was SO tender, succulent and flavourful. Probably one of the best chickens I've had.
The dessert perhaps was one of main stars of the show, as the chocolate textures together with the ice cream (I think?) and some kind of coffee caramel went so well together. A perfect finish.
Overall, this set menu is definitely for people that want familiar tasting yet high quality dishes, but perhaps not ideal if you want something new for your taste buds. The atmosphere is really intimate as well, definitely great as a date night spot �",4
"Finally tried this!!! Had the S'mores cookie ($5.50) to-go and reheated it as per the instructions. I was delighted by the gooey marshmallow in the middle, and how crispy the cookie dough is. This is definitely one VERY sinful dessert, but at least I enjoyed it mostly, maybe except for the fact that it may be abit too salty.",4
"This is perhaps a new take on the traditional pancake most Singaporeans are used to. Though the Matcha traditional pancake with peanut ($1.20 a slice) does not have much matcha flavour, the pancake itself is very well done. It is perfectly soft, fluffy and light. To top it off, the chunky peanut butter used was really generous and it made the dessert so darn wholesome.
My friends tried the Munchi Pancake with Belgian Chocolate ($1.80 a slice) and they were amazed by the quality and quantity of chocolate used. Definitely be back again to try more flavours!",4
"At first I thought the Har Geong Gai Chicken Wings ($1.80 each) were surfeiting, but they were pretty addictive to me! The crust was perfectly crispy and had the beautiful umami from the prawn paste marination. This will be perfect with some rice to ease down the saltiness.",4
"Had the all famous Yishun Laksa ($2.80/3.30) to go, and my oh my, even when it's left out there for an hour, it still tastes so good. Definitely a hearty soup with bold coconut milk flavours, this laksa has firm noodles with fresh cockles as well. Worth the 45 min wait? It just might!",4
"This place is famous among all the frog porridge places in Singapore, and it is indeed very hearty. Perfect for a rainy weather, the claypot frog legs with dried chilli ($22 for 4) has a nice kick, and the frogs are nicely tender and fresh! Paired with the plain porridge, this is really a satisfying meal.
The oyster omelette ($12 for medium) is worth a mention as well, as its a sizeable portion and though its not the crispy kind you usually get, it's a more flat version but packed with onions and spring onions that make it so sweet �",4
"The Academics Breakfast ($27.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) - was craving for some all day breakfast, and this (kinda) hits the spot. There were a good variety of ingredients, but most were rather average. It was rather worth it with the 1 for 1! The cafe has a really good setting though, great for a good talk with friends.",3
"Charcoal Grilled Whisky Ribeye ($26 with #burpplebeyond) - this is one of the better steaks I've had, as it was good medium rare and nicely tender, with a hint of smokiness. The red wine reduction sauce goes very well with the steak. Really worth it with the Burpple Beyond!",4
"The Artisan Chocolate ice cream is the best for me, due to its rich chocolate flavour, and the generous amounts of chocolate shavings in them.
The Speculoos has a deep cookie butter flavour, perfect for the fans out there.
The Earl Grey Lavender is abit of a miss for me, as the Earl Grey flavours are not too strong! Would be better if the ice cream is abit more milky too :)
Total price of the 3 scoops is $13.20.",4
"One thing you will notice is that almost everyone in the cafe are eating their waffles, and they are REALLY good. Their waffles are very fluffy and aromatic and loved their Turkey Ham and Cheese version ($15.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) as they had a good amount of cheese in them that paired with the waffles very well. The atmosphere is very chill, perfect for a good talk with your loved ones. The service is really good as well! Will be back definitely.",4
"A Hidden Korean Food Restaurant in One Raffles Place, and I must say the food here is really close to those you can find in South Korea. The Soondubu Jjigae ($12.90) packs a punch, but has a strong vegetable and seafood broth flavour. Paired with rice, this may be the most satisfying meal during a rainy day. The seafood pancake ($18) is crispy, fluffy and not too doughy, and its packed with seafood ingredients. Love how the charred flavour is nicely incorporated in the pancake!
The side dishes provided are really satisfying as well, and they are free flow ��",4
"One of the better korean fried chicken places in Singapore I would say, as the Original Fried Chicken ($18 for Half Portion) is extremely crispy and juicy including the breast meat piece! The Yang Neom Chicken ($21 for Half Portion) wasn't too crispy, but the sauce made it up for it as it was perfectly sweet and savoury and packed a punch!
We ordered a bowl of cheese tteokbokki ($18) as well, and it was so satisfying � the ingredients were definitely a notch above those you can buy from the supermarket!",5
"This may seem like a very unassuming shop, but be prepared to be surprised by their unique range of bubble tea flavours. The Brown Sugar Earl Grey Milk Tea ($2.90) was not too heavy and had a hint of Earl Grey, and the pearls were chewy. The Wintermelon with Zesty Lemon ($2.90) is really unique, and very refreshing!
#burpplebeyond is available here as well so that makes your drinks even cheaper �",4
"I feel that this place provides very honest fare using fresh ingredients, making this place a wonderful place to come with your loved ones for a good meal. The Yuzu Chicken ($18) appealed to me the most, with its rather tender and flavoured meat that has a hint of citrus from the Yuzu sauce. The BBQ Pork Ribs ($19) were fall-off-the-bone tender as well.
Their mocktails were very refreshing as well, and the Fizzy Yuzu ($8) came in an especially large jug!
Love their service staffs as well as they were all very hardworking and committed. Will be back again soon!",4
"Entering this restaurant will probably make you think that you're in Japan, as the experience is really authentic. The Yakitori Bento Lunch Set ($15.50) consist of chicken and pork skewers that were absolutely stunning. All skewers were very well seasoned and were grilled to perfection, with a touch of smokiness in them. None of the ingredients in the bento is neglected, including the ingredients on the rice. I must say, the quality of this bento is probably on par with those I've eaten in Japan. A wonderful meal indeed!",5
"Hands down one of the best salmon dish I've tried. The Salmon Madness ($19 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has a huge variety of vegetables that might put you off, but trust me they won't. The sautéed mushrooms and charred chillies add so much flavour to the dish, you will find them addictive. The main star of the dish, the salmon fillet, is extremely fresh and tender.
The truffle fries ($11) is a good side as well. Though the truffle taste is abit lacklustre, I appreciated the generous parmesan shavings. The portion is huge as well!",4
"Finally tried the all famous Nasi Lemak ($3.50) from Changi Village Hawker Centre, and I loved how fluffy and fragrant the rice was. You can really taste the lemak in the rice itself and really, you can just eat the rice itself without anything else. The chicken wings were nicely fried too!
My only two gripes is that the portion is really quite small, and the sambal is abit too sweet for me. Other than that, it's worth a try if you are around the area!",4
"Probably most Singaporeans living in the east would have heard of Bedok 85 Market, and yes it's really darn good each time I head there. After many experiences with the different stalls, I feel like the 2 bak chor mee stalls are pretty similar in standards. The fried oyster omelette are all pretty good as well with the crispy bits and rather fresh oysters.
I must say, the sambal stingray from the leftmost stall in the market (I can't remember the name of the stall �) is really generous with its portions! The medium sized portion looks like the large one in most stalls!",4
"This seafood restaurant offers really good zichar dishes as well and some that we ordered were the Champagne Pork Ribs ($20 for Large), Salted Egg Yolk Prawn ($22 for Small), Prawn Paste Chicken ($20 for Large) and the Sliced Fish with Ginger ($22 for Large). All dishes were very well cooked, but were slightly too savoury! The best to me is the Sliced Fish with Ginger, because the sauce goes very well with rice and it's very satisfying to mop up all the gravy!
You can use #burpplebeyond here and that will definitely save up so much costs �",4
"The ambience at this cafe is already good, but the food here is even better. The Impossible Burger ($27.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has a good pairing sauce with the Impossible burger patty, and the sweet potato fries are on another level. So crispy and fluffy!
The 3 meat pizza ($25.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has a generous amount of cheese and the dough has a nice bite. Loved the crispy crust!
Overall, a beautiful cafe to have a long good chat with your loved ones ��",4
"Ali Nazik ($22.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond): Now this is an interesting dish. The eggplant yogurt mixture and the char grilled chicken are incredibly smoky, and paired with the bread just made it a whole lot nicer. The Adana Lamb Kebabs ($24 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) were abit too dry, but the Sucuk and Eggs Pide ($22.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) won our hearts as it was beautifully stuffed with cheese and the dough was so soft �",4
"This is some legit old school western food right here. The chicken chop ($7) is really well seasoned and grilled, with a crispy crust that adds a nice texture. The meat is surprising really tender, and I would say this is really one of the better ones out there.",4
"Straight up: outstanding food with incredible queueing systems and service.
The Australian Pork Jowl ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is really done perfectly, with incredibly tender and succulent pieces of pork that is beautifully charred. Everything is there for a reason, including the picked cabbage below that makes this dish less surfeiting.
The Smoked Duck with Thai Red Curry ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) boasts very bold curry that is really addictive! Very good dish in general just that I find smoked duck in curry abit strange at first.
The Tiger Prawn Capellini ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is a fail-safe, with fresh prawns and good al dente pasta.
The Truffle Shoestring Fries ($6) are really addictive and a good side to your dishes. Though the truffle taste is minimal, it's really just $6 for a substantial amount!
The service is to be commended for, and I love how their queuing system works; while in other restaurants people wait in line, you get to leave your number and continue shopping till they manage to find a table for you.",4
"This is one of the hidden cafes in bedok that is serving up really superb dishes. The jalapeño beef ragu waffles ($18.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) indeed sounds strange, but it works so well. The deep meaty flavour of the ragu with bacon, topped with the multiflora honey provided, together with the fluffy waffles, will hit you with an explosion of flavours. This is definitely something interesting and I will be back for more. The service is superb as well! ���",4
"One peek into the coffeeshop at night and you know what's popular there. This is one of my go-to spots for mookata, as the meats given are so well seasoned and tender. Don't worry about their portions as they are generous with it. A 3 person set ($38) is more than enough for 3 hungry bellies!",4
"Visited Positano's new outlet at Circular Road and I was madly impressed. The pizzas we ordered were one of best I've had so far. The Truffle Mushroom Pizza and 6 Cheese Pizza ($22.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) both boasted really fresh ingredients and the cheese were in their right amounts. What differentiates the pizzas here from the rest is the dough. The thin crusted dough stayed chewy and never soggy throughout, and the crust is so darn crispy even when it's cold.
Service here is excellent as well. Loved the smiles from the waiters and how they approached us asking if we wanted more pamersan on our pizza. Will definitely be back again!",5
"Circuit Road Hawker Centre has an abundant amount of vegetarian food and this wanton mee ($3.50/$4) from Meng Heng Vegetarian Food is one of the best I've tried. The noodles is the star of the dish, due to its firm texture and the chilli sauce that coats around it is really addictive.
The Vegetarian Otah ($2 per piece) from Victor Veggie is interesting as well and has a nice spicy kick!",4
"The Jawbreaker ($22 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) - honestly one of the biggest burgers I've seen around. The patties were indeed juicy, but the cheese sauce makes it too surfeiting. Will try their other burgers next time!",4
"Grilled Lamb Don - $18 ( 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) Yes, the meat slices were tender and flavourful and paired well with the sous vide egg and rice, but I have a slight doubt. There were no gaminess in the meat, making me wonder whether I was served lamb meat. Tasted more like pork actually.",4
"When I called and they said they were fully booked, I knew I was in for a treat.
The braised beef cheeks ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) was incredibly tender; you don't even need a knife for this. With its deep beefy flavour, it paired well with the red wine sauce, as well as the sautéed mushrooms and mash.
The BBQ Pork Ribs ($25 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was well seasoned and once again, fall-off-the-bone tender. The portion was quite huge as well and I'm glad they did not neglect the sides. The wedges were crispy even after being out cold for long. The homemade slaw tasted fresh.
The Prawn Basil Pesto Pasta ($23 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was al-dente and the prawns were plump and fresh. Loved the deep pesto flavour.
The Truffle Kombu Fries ($15) had a big portion enough for 3-4 to share, and though the truffle flavour was light, the fries were so crispy and addictive it was so hard to stop.
Honestly, there wasn't much that I was unhappy about. Service was amazing although the place was packed. What a great atmosphere to dine in as well!",5
"Found a hidden gem for Vietnamese food! Strongly recommended if you are in paya lebar!
The Pho Tai Nam ($8.30) had a generous portion with a light broth that greatly resembles the ones I had in Vietnam. Absolutely loved the silky smooth noodles!
The Banh Mi with grilled pork chop ($6) had a crispy baguette crust with really smoky grilled pork slices. Loved the spicy tangy sauce in the Banh Mi!
The fried spring rolls ($5.50) were one of the most addictive ones I had; it does not taste too oily! A must get to share!
The banana dessert ($4) was underwhelming though, as the coconut milk is way too thick and sweet.
Overall, its a good place for Vietnam food in the east! Do opt for the alfresco dining as it adds alot to the atmosphere!",4
"In need for some Korean fried chicken with beer or soju? Take a little trip down to Seoul Good at the Punggol East Container Park that has nice vibes for some good chi-maek! The soy garlic special chicken ($17.90 for 12 pcs) has the sweet savoury kick that you are looking for. The shoyu chicken ($9.90 for 6 pcs) in fact gave me the best impression, as it remains its crispiness with the slight saltiness from the shoyu.
The sugar mummy tower (yogurt soju) we got was $69.90. Overall, its a pretty chill place for some drinks with friends! Best of all, no gst and service charge ���",4
"The Rebel Company Cafe & Bar offers a wide selection of food items, and we ordered the Hungry Rebel Beef burger and the Rib-eye steak. The burger surpassed our expections, with 2 wholesome juicy patties that had full-on flavour. Paired with bacon, cheese and guacamole, the burger was near perfection.
The steak on the other hand was tough, although it had some flavour.
These were available on burpple beyond (meat lover set for $39.90 for 2 people) and it included bottle beers!",4
"Chun Qiu Restaurant serves Shandong cuisine, and I must say that they are doing a really good job. The Beef Poached in Chill Oil ($15) was HUGE and it came with so many pieces of tender fragrant beef slices. The twice cooked pork ($12) was really addictive. The shredded pork stir fry ($12) was really tender and fragrant and goes perfectly well with some rice. Ended up we couldn't finish and the amount left is definitely enough for another 3 people! Definitely will be back again!",4
"Finally tried this! The Grilled Chicken Chop ($5.90)had the right amount of char and the herb potatoes was one of the best roasted potatoes that I've tried. It had a really flavourful savoury crisp on the outside, and creamy on the inside. The mushroom rice was lacklustre though. The handmade meatballs ($5.80) we ordered on the side came with 6-7 meatballs and you can taste that they were freshly made!
In short, this is definitely a notch above any Hawker centre western food but I queued 1h for this (it's normal to do so, as all items are made to order) and I wouldn't think it is worth an hour's wait? Half hour wait is fine �",5
"Still one of the places with the best burgers - although the waiting time was unusually long that day, our patience paid off as we were greeted by this wonderful Cheese and Whiskers ($18.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond). The brioche bun had the satisfying crispy exterior, the thick cheese layer although not stringy, had the deep salty milky taste and the patty was so tender. The sauce in the burger wonderfully completed the experience!
The fries are worth a mention; so satisfying crispy and fluffy even when it's cold!",4
"Twenty Grammes has been my constant for ice cream desserts if I'm in the area, because the waffles here are one of the best I've eaten. Crispy on the outside and perfectly fluffy in the inside; I wish I can get their waffles receipe! The waffles here are paired with their Dark Chocolate and Earl Grey ice cream. The Dark Chocolate was velvety smooth and incredibly rich. The Earl Grey was milky and had the perfect amount of earl grey flavours in them.
Whats even better is that this is available for #burpplebeyond! 2 double scoop waffles for just ~$13.80 omggg?!",4
"The mala xiang guo here ($24 for an abundant amount for 3 people) is really fragrant, and what's better is that the numbness is customizable as well! For the price, it's really worth it as we ordered quite abit of meat!
Be careful, because this shop's mala spice is heavier than the most places! The small spice here is equivalent to the medium spice in most places.",4
"Now this might be expensive, selling at $7.80 a piece, but it's really good if you love your chicken abit on the sweeter side. The chicken is tender and well marinated and coating has a good crunch. The flavour profile is more of a sweet-savoury kind; extremely satisfying!",4
"This is a hidden find and I'm glad I came down for this. The salmon fillet ($19.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was really fresh and well cooked. Really appreciated the crispy skin, although I wasn't too used to the tangy sauce.
The truffle mushroom pasta ($16.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) had a good amount of truffle taste and the mushrooms were really well sautéed.
Their famous iced lavender latte ($7.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was a pleasant surprise, as the floral note really complemented the coffee well.
A great find! Their steaks look so good honestly, will be back for them!",4
"Honestly, one of my most favourite places to get my burger fix. The Baconator ($17.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is a fail-safe option with a really juicy patty and crispy turkey bacon. The sauce within the burger is superb as well!
For the cheese lovers, you have to get the Cheese & Whiskers ($17.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) as it comes with a thick slab of melted cheese that is definitely enough to satisfy your cravings.
Both burgers come with buttered brioche bun that is beautifully toasted. The fries are really good as well. With their wonderful service and sick music vibes, this place is perfect for date night or a simple gathering! Well done @workingtitlesg !",5
"Curry Hor Fun?? What is going on?? The very unique curry chicken hor fun ($10 for medium size) from this zi char stall is drenched in really fragrant curry and has loads of fresh chicken and fish slices.
The claypot big prawn glass noodles ($15 for small, enough for 2 don't worry) came with 6 large prawns. Though the prawns weren't the freshest, the glass noodles really soaked up all of the umami flavours coming from the prawn and has that beautiful wok hei.
The salted egg yolk pork ribs ($15 for medium) is quite different from other zi char stalls as it is dry on the outside but don't worry. The meat sure is tender and succulent.
What a good find� will be back real soon once this whole situation is over!",4
"Service is wonderful, the unicorn tears ice cream ($7) is huge and aesthetic, but taste wise... I think its possible to get better ones out there. There's a whole lot of colouring in there as well so prepared to get your mouth blue from the ice cream.",3
"Looking for Korean food? Say no more as this is one of my go-to for Korean food as the quality is almost on par as the ones I've had in Seoul. The cheese chi-queen ($32.90) is the one you want to look for if you like your chicken drenched in that lovely gooey cheese. Both fried chicken options, original ($26.90) and garlic soy ($28.90) arrive piping hot and stay crispy even when they are cold. Pair them with a bottle of beer and you have the authentic chi-maek experience you dream of. 짠!",5
"The sambal fish and chips ($16.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) came with generous portions of fish and fries. They were pretty well fried, but I find the batter of the fish abit too thick.
The Ribena Wings ($8.90) I would think of this as a love or hate thing, and if you love your wings on a sweeter side, then this is for you.
The burgers look good though! Will be back to try them another day!",3
"Now this place really do live up to its name. The Chaota Belly Good ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is beautifully charred, with the outside forming a satisfying crust while keeping the inside incredibly tender and succulent. You can smell the smoke within the meat itself. To me, this meat doesn't need the pairing sauce and its one of the best I've tried.
The Asari Clams Aglio Olio ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has the beautiful reduced clam stock as its sauce and it coated around each strand perfectly. Not too heavy tasting, this dish can be a good pairing to the Belly Good!",4
"Love the soup from the prawn and pork ribs noodles ($6) here as you can taste the fragrance of the prawn within the soup itself. Portion wise isn't too bad; quite bit of pork ribs were given together with the prawn!
Of course, some wu xiang to go with your noodles is recommended �",4
"To me, this dessert stall serves up one of the thickest and most delicious Chendol ($2) and Ice Kachang ($2) in Singapore. They weren't too sickly sweet but the aromatic flavours from the massive amounts of coconut milk in the Chendol will definitely make you come back for more!",4
"May look like a very underwhelming store, but they serve up pretty decent quality ramen at cheap prices! The Black Garlic Ramen ($15.80 with a tempura and a drink 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) actually taste pretty great. The soup is aromatic and the noodles are springy. $7.90 per person for the set, I have absolutely no complaints!",4

"Back at Rakki after more than half a year, and the quality remains as good. The bara-chirashi ($22.90 for regular 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond ) has a generous amount of chunky and fresh salmon and swordfish pieces. You can definitely taste the truffle oil in the truffle wagyu don ($27.90 for large 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the beef slices are so tender and flavourful. Gonna be back for more!",4
"You may leave this place smelling like smoke, but it guaranteed that you will leave with a happy belly. From famous chicken wings to sambal stingrays to beautifully charred satays, all food was really good. But what stood out was the oyster omelette at Ang Sa Lee ($8 for this medium portion) it is more starchy as compared to their other stalls I've tried in Singapore and I love the slight chewiness. Don't worry, it still have some crispiness and char to go with it as well!",4
"I'm pretty sure most will come here for their cheap quality Thai dishes, but their Thai Chilli Chicken Cutlet ($10) is something I want to rave about. Very crispy light batter with really succulent chicken, paired with a tangy slightly spicy sauce, this is one addictive dish!",4
"Heard alot about the cafe here and I must say the food has the consistency and quality that will definitely impress you. All of the food ordered were very well prepared and each of my friends have their own favourites, but mine gotta be the Herbs De Provence Beef Pasta ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and the Truffle Scented Mushroom Pizza ($23 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond).
The portion of the Beef Pasta is just nice and it came with a rather big piece of steak. The steak itself is tender, flavourful and beautifully medium rare. Pasta itself was especially fragrant and had the perfect al dente texture.
The mushroom pizza had SO MUCH cheese. The truffle oil, though light, did not musk the nature flavour of the mushrooms but instead elevated it. So darn addictive!
This place has a good atmosphere as well, perfect for a chill time with friends or even a date �",4
"Absolutely love the food quality and quantity that Biseryu provides, as it is definitely a notch above the rest. The Roast Beef Don ($22 for medium 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is really satisfying as the roast beef is so tender and flavourful. Paired with the sauce and onsen egg, you get the perfect blend of flavours that is going to make you come back for more.
The chicken cutlet with beef patty ($23 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is REALLY huge and they are fried to perfection. The beef patty is really juicy, definitely one of the star of the dish! Will be back for more ��",5

"First time to this dessert place and I am really impressed. The durian sago ($6.50), although came in a rather small portion, but the ingredients used were superb. The creamy durian puree had a good mix between bitter and sweet. The sago with cream was just nicely sweet and paired with the durian puree really well.
The mango sago ($4) was good, but you can get such quality somewhere else as well. The durian sago is definitely the must try when you're here!",4
"Don't ever underestimate this bowl of minced meat noodles ($4) as I absolutely love the springiness of the noodles combined with the ultimate umami flavours coming from the chilli. I've been visiting this stall for years and the quality stays constant throughout! Totally my regular bowl of bak chor mee whenever I'm craving for it!
My Father's Minced Meat Noodle",4
I've been visiting this stall for years and the quality stays constant throughout! Totally my regular bowl of bak chor mee whenever I'm craving for it!,4
"Bak kut teh ($8) - the star of the dish gotta be the pork ribs of course, as there were very tender and fresh! The soup is peppery, abit too peppery in my opinion to appreciate it completely. The pig organ soup ($8) came with many ingredients and my favourites hve to be the liver and intestines! The liver is melt-in-the-mouth and the intestines had little to no odour in them ��",4
"In hot sunny Singapore, nothing beats good single scoop gelato come ($5.20 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) from @aromagelato.sg especially if you're in Arab Street! The texture of the gelato is nicely chewy. The rum and raisin is really fragrant and the peppermint chocolate is really refreshing �",4
"Visited this bar for my first time and it will be a bar I know I will visit often.
The truffle mushroom linguine ($22) was so fragrant and the truffle taste was very strong. Portions are rather big as well!
The beef brisket ($32) had 4 thick slices of beef brisket which was so succulent, tender and flavourful.
The Stoner burger ($24) boast a very juicy patty that went well with their house sauces. Wished that the patty can be a little bit softer though!
The Moby burger ($22) is my personal favourite and the fish fillet given was so darn meaty and fresh! In fact, it is one of the best I've tried.
All of the fries and onion rings provided are one of the best I've tried as well, and I could not stop eating them! And did I mention that all of the mains stated are available 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond? This makes such a quality meal so much more worth it �� thank you @mischief.sg for such a good meal!",5
"Claypot rice ($7/$13/$23) - really worth it, because the claypot rice here is not only flavourful, but packed with tons of ingredients. The salted fish pieces here are not fried, but they are in huge chunks so probably better to mash and mix them in! The service in here is really good as well! Can't wait to be back again for my claypot cravings!
Eng's Wanton Mee and Claypot Rice @ East Village",4
"Always been a regular at Tom's Palatte, because there is always some interesting flavours from time to time. A 4oz cup cost $5 (1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and you can get up to 2 flavours. The viet coffee was strong on its coffee notes, great for people looking for less sweet ice cream. The yuzu has been my all-time favourite and I love the critus tang. Absolutely refreshing!",4
"Back to zam zam to try their Biryani instead and was very impressed. The chicken Biryani ($6.50) had a huge quarter chicken and was pleasantly flavourful. The beef Biryani ($6.50) was even more impressive, with its huge tender, succulent beef chunk. The beef may not be reddish, but it does contain a spicy kick!",4
"The steak is definitely a rather good cut; the meat was nicely tender and was really juicy. However, it lacked abit in terms of flavour, perhaps it was not too well seasoned! With the Burpple Beyond, it is still a worth it piece of steak!",4
"For ice cream waffles (~$16 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond), this is one good place to get really good ice cream and waffles as both has the quality you are looking for. My favourite flavours got to be dark chocolate and earl grey, as both flavours are really thick and flavourful; just how I like my ice cream. The waffles are really fluffy as well. Chill atmosphere; I can really stay here for a good long conversations with quality friends!",4
"Had a wonderful meal at @citrusbythepool, a very homely halal cafe located within woodlands sports centre.
The Fried Chicken & Waffle ($15.90) is a signature dish and I must say, the waffle itself is already notch above other restaurants. The waffle was fluffy and crisp on the outside and had a buttery taste that was indeed addictive.
Though the burger bun from Da Burger Bomb ($11.90) may seem a little flat, don't underestimate the teriyaki chicken within. Perfectly charred, the chicken was tender, juicy and flavourful. This, to me, should be one of the signatures as well.
The Seafood Aglio Olio ($14.50) was decent and seafood used were really fresh.",4
"Now this is one of my favourites; I love how the broth signature beef noodles is so flavourful and aromatic and how wonderful the texture of the handmade noodles are! Generous portions of tender beef slices are given as well! Service at the Singpost Centre outlet is wonderful as well. The noodles are halal as well!
Oh did I mention that it is on #burpplebeyond as well? 1 for 1 main with drink is only $13.80, making it only $6.90 a person �",4

Glutinous rice balls from Ah Balling have been consistently good since their opening and I absolutely love the chewy texture of the balls and their creamy peanuty filling � 4 rice balls with soup is only $2.20!,4
"The charcoal fish head steamboat ($25/$35/$45 for red grouper) was full of fish slices that were really fresh and firm. Though the fish slices does lack abit in taste, the accompanying sauces did the job. The winner has to be the soup, as it had a slight herbal flavour but a sweet seafood taste from boiling the fish bones for many hours. Really comforting meal indeed!",4
"The cone was crispy and buttery, but overall I feel its really abit too pricey though.",3
"You may think that the fish head doesn't have alot of meat, but don't worry as this was a sharable portion between 3-4 people!",3
"Yes that exist. Angie's oyster bar is a bar located in the business district with terrace seating that has really beautiful views overlooking the Marina Bay area. You may think that such bars will be really expensive, but it is not as their drinks are only $10++ during their happy hours! Their oysters run from $1++ during their happy hours from 6pm to 8pm and they are really not bad at all! Beautiful views with great drinks, this is definitely a place to chill with your friends or even a romantic date �",4
"I was very impressed by their execution of Chinese dishes! The Chef J's BBQ pork cheek ($14.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was so tender and succulent, with a deep char flavour� The claypot prawn tang hoon ($17.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) had fresh succulent prawns and a deep seafood flavour in the noodles. Loved the wok hei in the noodles as well! Will be back for more�",5
"The omelette was crispy on the edges and yet firm on the inside. The whole oysters were so plump and fresh as well, making this dish so addictive!",4
"Both claypot dishes were very hearty and you know fresh ingredients were used. With the #burpplebeyond set @ $15 for the 2 claypot dish, 2 salted vegetable dish, 2 bowls of rice and 2 drinks, this is a complete steal �",4
"The cheeseburger is really juicy (thankful for that) but I wished that the patties had more flavour. I do love the customizable burger option, as I can add items like camerlised onions and mushrooms for free, which I absolutely adore.
The fries ($9 for a regular size) came in really large portions. The fries were rather thick cut and you really can taste the potato within. Overall, it taste like a really good fast food burger and fries.
Don't forget the free peanuts that I feel were really fresh!",4
"I tried the Bailey's and Milo Choco Fudge ($4.20 per scoop 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and was impressed by their light creamy texture, but flavourful notes. The Bailey's ice cream had a slight alcoholic taste, but have was rich and creamy. The Milo Choco Fudge have that malty flavour, with occasional pieces of choco fudge!",4
"The Pad Thai ($6), Pineapple Fried Rice ($6) and Tom Yum Talay ($10) have a very homely taste and you tell that they used fresh ingredients. A slight blooper was that my Pad Thai was a tad too soggy! Pair it with Thai Milk Tea ($1.80) for the complete Thai food experience!",4
"The patties are done well, as they are pretty juicy! As for seasoning, it would have been perfect if the patties have a little more pepper in them. The cheese used in the burger complements the other ingredients really well! Loving the beautiful service given by the owner! #burpple",4
"If you are the person that loves the fatty layer in your sio bak, you will definitely love this one. The pork belly slices are seasoned extremely well, as there are little foul pork odour. Each slice came with a huge amount of smokiness, which will definitely make you appreciate the every single piece you devour.",4
"(Cheese & Whiskers $14.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) - Buttered brioche bun, soft flavourful patty and HELLA lot of cheese. What more can I ask for?
Service at working title is brilliant as well, and they have live music on Thursdays. Great for date nights *hint hint* @workingtitlesg",4
"This plate of 4 items cost $5.20, making it one of the most valuable for money wu xiang out there. Portions are relatively bigger as well, with items costing $1.20 - $1.80 each.
Zhong zhong Ngo Hiang Prawn Cracker",4
"Sloppy and messy piece of burger, but that's when you know it's good. Though a fast food chain, everything in their double cheese burger ($9.90 for set) taste really fresh, and I love it that their patties are not overcooked. Their twister fries can't really go wrong, but hell they're addictive. I really do appreciate that their root beer float comes in a chilled mug, as the float stays cold throughout my whole meal.
Is it worth the 1h wait? Well maybe for the novelty. There are better burger houses out there without that enormous queue.",4
"Popular among the students, they offer really good flavours such as the valrhoma chocolate and their alcoholic beer. ($3.30 per scoop, add 0.60 for alcoholic and premium flavours). Great for after meal desserts!",3
"Deli's kitchen is a hole in the wall restaurant located in the quiet sunshine plaza, and their food standards gave me a good surprise. Their roast beef don ($17 for 100g bowl 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is probably the best I've tried in a while. Their beef slices are so fresh that they taste so clean. Paired with the onsen egg and the flavoured rice below, this bowl will definitely skyrocket you straight up to food haven.
Their Pork Loin katsu with ebi ($17 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is beautifully fried as well. The pork loin is free of the pork odour that many wouldn't like, and will taste even better with the sauces available at the side.
A must try for both beyond and non-beyond users. You know its legit when the waiter and customers are Japanese.",4
"I had no regrets getting this, as the pasta was al dente, and the pesto sauce had just the right amount of pesto that isn't too overwhelming.
The seared salmon was good as well; you know they cooked it well when you can hear the crunch as you bite into the salmon skin and the meat melting away without much effort to chew.
Spagtacular has a really pretty layout, with really good honest food. Highly recommended to come down to try this pasta if you're down in the area! @spagtacular_",5
"Both cups are decent, and the milk tea do taste better than the regular milk teas out there. Pearls are chewy. Pretty worth with the Burpple Beyond!",3
"The rosti is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The veal sausage is juicy and really flavourful as well!
As for the steak and cheese sandwich, I absolutely love the ciabatta bun, as it is nicely grilled on the stove. The steak slices are rather tough, but well seasoned.
Overall, this is really value for money with burpple beyond! Best of all, NO GST AND SERVICE CHARGE. A must try for dear burpple beyond users!",4
"Among the crowded and chattering bars at Boat Quay, lies DePizza where they provide a good atmosphere for you and your friends to chill. The pizzas offered here have thin crusts, and were generous with the ingredients.
I especially liked this one, as you can tell the tomato based sauce is fresh, and the layer of cheese was really thick, and have that really cheese pull you long for in every pizza.",4
"Food at Royal Palm surpassed my expectations. Although their prices are relatively low for a buffet, they do not skim on their food quality. The Indian food section has one of the best naans and chicken malasa that I've tried. The tandoori chicken is incredibly smoky and flavourful; a must get in this buffet. I'm very surprised that they have hummus as well, and a good quality one indeed! Furthermore, it's halal-certified!",5
"Prepare to be greeted by generous amounts of THICC fat slices of salmon, tuna and swordfish with a perfectly balanced bowl of lightly seasoned rice below. With burpple beyond, I will say that this is a steal. Can't wait to be back to try the signature truffle wagyu don!",5
"This is probably one of the best sambal stingrays that I have tried, because of its incredible smokiness. Their sambal do pack a punch, but is really rich. Do get avocado juice from a nearby drink stall to cool the spice!",4
"They don't short change on their desserts as well, as each of them are perfectly crafted.
Beach road kitchen is currently having an Indonesian fare with chefs flown in from Bali. Be ready to be greeted by more than 8 types of sambals and perfectly cooked Indonesian dishes that taste really authentic. My personal favourite would be their grilled fishes and iberico pork cuts. Variety is amazing here. I tried to try every dish myself within a single meal, but it's not possible!
Duration of fare: now till 27th July
Price: 90++ for Mon to Sat dinner",4
"Yes, with #burpplebeyond it's possible. Although it's not the best, it's not too bad either considering the spread available (scallops, bamboo clams, mutton slices, etc). You're able to satisfy your mala cravings definitely. Do note that your clothes will smell of mala oil after the meal, so just go really casual if you want to!",3
"Now this is one hidden gem in the East, as each ingredient prepared are really fresh, with the meats being the star of the show. The pork and chicken slices are seasoned well and are really tender and succulent! Star of the show would definitely be the pork belly, which are bursting with juices. Portions are good and service is superb as well. Highly recommended for my dear Easties!",5
"Crossings cafe is a social enterprise that not only hires people with special needs, but profits will go to charitable organisations as well.
The beef burger patty was rather tough, but the meal experience was saved overall due their fresh salads, perfectly done fries and the great service provided by the staffs.
I might have ordered the wrong dish, as the pork ribs ordered at a nearby table do seem really tender! Will be back for more!",4
"Take a piece of the smoky wagyu with that truffle sauce, dip it in the onsen egg and pair that with rice and you have an explosion of flavours in your mouth. Beef slices are mostly tender. I do wish that the truffle taste could be stronger and the rice could be flavoured though!
On a side note, service is excellent here and the ambience is rather amazing. Great for date night spots!",4
"Yes they did give me a whole lot of sides ranging from small and big wantons to really tender pork ribs. Their sides are on point, but I was rather disappointed by their noodles as they were not that flavourful and it didn't have the bite I was looking for. Hopefully it's because of the takeaway!",3
"The meat was really tender and juicy, and didn't need any sauce to go with it. Rather than the variety, their quantity do shine for certain dishes such as their wood fire pizzas and bread pudding.
Worth it if you get the 1 for 1 @chopesg voucher for about $50!",4
"A single scoop cookie dough with soft serve sets you back at ($6.50 1 For 1 with #burpplebeyond) and it seems small, but trust me it's enough. Cookies and cream and lemon tart are the best for me, as you can't get wrong with cookies and cream, and the lemon tart flavour has that citrus scent that copes with the sweetness of the cookie dough. For all the sweet tooths out there, rejoice!!",4
"The chicken chop was surprisingly one of the best I've tried in a while, as the chicken chop was thick and succulent. Portions for their mains and pastas are generous as well.
On a side note, I just love how Spagtacular plays softer music and sets up a great ambience for some chill vibes.",4
"Kogane Yama's chirashi don ($15.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) comes in an amazing portion, as well as a great sashimi:rice ratio. Each bowl comes with salmon and tuna cuts, as well as prawns and scallops. All seafood prepared are really fresh, and I love it how I can enjoy the bowl even without putting any sauce. Definitely back again for more!",4
"The chocolate stout is definitely heavy on the stout flavours, but interestingly enough, the bitter chocolate actually complements it so well. Rum and raisin is so good as well, as the raisins are plump and the fragrance of the rum lingers.
They have matchaya green tea as well, which is perfect with the Thai milk tea, to make it a semi sweet fragrant combination.
A 4oz cup in the picture is $5, but once again #burpplebeyond is here to save your wallet.",4
"The seemingly harmless Grilled pork neck noodles ($5.90 during lunch hours) will greet you with a kick that will definitely make you gulp that Thai milk tea you would order with it.
Aside from that, the grilled pork neck pieces, although abit tough, are incredibly smoky and addictive. It's a great bowl nonetheless, and can be a place to go when you're around the area!",4
Many parts of the omelette are crispy and the oysters are really succulent! It's best with the chilli sauce to give the omelette a spicy sour kick!,4
"Juicy wagyu patties, crispy bacon slices, and lots of cheese? That's a winner burger for you. Although a little tough, the patties were still juicy nevertheless and the rest of the ingredients are fresh as well.
I gotta say I somehow love their bun more than anything else, because of its crispy crust and fluffy insides, which is rare as many places don't put their focus on the bun!
Prices in their menu are nett prices including their beer pints, a rare find for bars around the area.",4
"The lunch set meal ($16++ 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) comes with a noodle, a plate of dumplings, and a drink. I highly recommend that you get the braised pork noodles, as the braised pork pieces are so soft and tender, and when mixed around with the al dente noodles and the other sauces below, the umami flavours are so heavily pronounced you crave more for each mouthful you take.
The smoked duck dumplings are also a recommendation, as the strong flavour of the dumplings goes so well with the picked onions.
The drink I got was the salted plum, wolfberry pu'er, and it was also so carefully thought-out. Everything complemented and harmonised each other so well you have to try, especially when you work in the CBD area!",5
"One thing you have to know is that the portion of the ice cream is REALLY big. It's almost triple the size of a normal vanilla ice cream cone. Furthermore, it melts really quickly, so it is better for you to find a mall to eat it. Taste wise, it taste definitely better than a usual milk ice cream cone, but I did expected more from this shop.",3
"The Hojicha tea notes are strong, but not too bitter, hence most will be able enjoy this. Twenty Grammes waffles are indeed a rare find, because they are light and fluffy, yet real crispy on the outside. Definitely worth a check-out if you are in the area!
#burpple",4
"Ordered the double scoops ($9 1 for 1 with burpple beyond including premium flavours) and best flavours will be the chocolate hojicha and the pistachio. The chocolate hojicha has that nice blend of both flavour notes, and the pistachio has that strong frangant nutty flavour I was looking for. All of the ice creams are on the softer side, but somehow do not melt easily. Staffs are friendly as well. Great spot for a quick ice cream fix after a drink at the nearby bars!",4
"Came into the bar not expecting much, but left with a full heart and stomach.
I ordered the burger with aged Cheddar and bacon ($17), and it was perfect. The patty was thick and juicy and full-on flavour, the aged cheese gave the extra earthiness, and the other vegetables and sauces used in the burger were really fresh and complemented the patty so beautifully. The sourdough bun held everything together and soaked up whatever juices that leaked from all of the ingredients.
Steak fries ($10) were really fluffy and you can really taste the potato.
For drinks I had the gluckbringer ($14), which was a tad too sweet for me, but should be fine for most people. I love my cocktails a little more sour, hence the mojito ($14) would have been a better choice.",4
"Now this Biryani is on a whole new level. The mutton-on-a-bone is really tender and has little to no gaminess. The curry goes perfectly with the nicely seasoned and spiced basmati rice. The portion is huge as well. Get a non-sweet teh limau($2.50) to counter the heaviness of the biryani itself!
The chicken murtarbak(~$8) is really good as well, as they managed to make the prata dough slightly crispy, which adds another dimension to the murtarbak itself. This is way better than most murtarbaks I've tried in other places. I didn't even need curry go with it!",5
"This is a place you must bring your friends or your family, as the food here is superb, yet really well priced. We ordered about 6 dishes, including the Thai green curry ($6), Tom Yum fried rice ($6) and the Tom Yum Soup ($6.80) which were the more notable ones.
The Thai green curry was really creamy and strong in the Thai basil flavours which I love alot. The Tom Yum fried rice was so good on its own that we cleared it within 5 minutes, and totally forgot to squeeze the lime. The Tom Yum soup was refreshing and the seafood used are really fresh.
Did I mention that you can also use your burpple beyond? With the beyond discounts our total bill for 5 people turned out to be $39.60, super affordable to the mass and we left with really happy tummies. Will be back for more!",5
"One word. SUCCULENT. The chopped pork Lechón are extremely tender and juicy. Forget about the calories (and fats) and just enjoy this wonderful porky goodness that will send you back wanting more. In my opinion, this is so much better than the Chinese sio bak. Get a plate of chilli with light soya sauce to drizzle the pork with for extra kick!",5
"The main star of the dish would definitely be the Har Cheong Kai itself, as the chicken is so darn succulent and flavourful as well. It's like the ones you get from the zi char stalls, just that without the bones. (perfect!) The buns were not really worth a mention, but the fries though. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, nicely salted and peppered, what more can I say?
Drinks wise the coffees are on the bitter side, very much the way coffee should be. Get their dual latte ($7) and you will be rewarded with the instagrammable coffee ice cubes with milk on the side for you to take the much needed boomerangs.",4
"Nunsongyee's desserts are on the pricer side as compared to regular soft serves, but they do hit the spot when you crave for Korean desserts around the area. The Oreo Bingsu is one of the classics one must definitely try.
Dont try to pour the condensed milk over the Oreo powder please. All the milk will definitely be below the bowl instead. Make a hole, then pour into the ice within! They will soak them all up!",4
"TAP boasts many different varieties of craft beers that come straight from the chilled taps (not from bottles!). Each craft beer ($10 per pint 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) have their own unique characteristics, and I would say that the critus and fruity flavours are safe for most first timers.
Their bar snacks do have quality as well, and their truffles fries ($12 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) did give the truffle kick we all craved for.",4
"aRoma's gelato definitely ain't the best I've tried, but it's worth it if you use the Burpple Beyond! We got the piccolo cup ($6.70 double scoop inclusive of a premium flavour). Flavour wise we felt like aRoma will need to intensify the flavour notes of the ice cream to differentiate them, as my friends agreed that the mocha and chocolate tasted roughly the same, and the run and raisin and earl grey tasted roughly similar too.",3
"Prepare to spend a long time trying to cut the long strands of cheese because it almost seem impossible with this dish. For any cheese lover, this dish is a must get because its so SHIOK dipping your fried chicken tenders in the really cheesy sauce. The potato wedges at the bottom are heavenly as well, as they get a little burnt and get well coated with all the cream sauce. It's truly the queen of all cheesy fried chicken!",4
"Brought my large group of friends to try out KOOK's Creamery, and the lava cookie with single scoop ice cream and hot tea ($12.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) never disappoints. We order 6 cookies with ice cream, and hence tried a plethora of flavours that includes Thai Milk Tea, Blue Chai Hokkaido Milk, Arabica Coffee, Speculoos, Earl Grey and Dark Chocolate.
All of the flavours were good, but the best combination I feel will be either the Earl Grey or the Arabica Coffee with the chocolate cookie. This is because both flavours are not on the sweeter side, and the fragrance of tea or coffee adds a contrasting element to the dessert as the cookie is really sweet and heavy. All 11 of us left happy!",5
"I ordered the linguine with mixed bell peppers and mixed mushrooms ($7) and honestly I was disappointed with the texture of the noodles as well as the ingredients. Portions were not too great too.
However, their cheddar sauce on the other hand was really thick, creamy and flavourful, but I felt like it didn't compliment the pasta well. Perhaps I chose the wrong sauce. They do live up to their name for being famous for their sauces, but perhaps their fries could have been a better compliment to their Cheddar sauce?",3
"Nine fresh has been my constant for desserts for a long time now, due to its low price point and mildly sweet desserts. I ordered the Grass Jelly Special ($2.30) as I never liked the beans or peanuts in this dessert. The milk packet that they give is a must put! The portion is always too much for me, hence a good bowl to share with another person :)",4
"I was on a Burrple Eat-up for their new menu, and being my first time here at this restaurant, I'm very surprised by the standards of this restaurant located in humble katong.
First thing first, their ambience is great to have a chill dinner here with your friends, as they have soft lightings, chill music, and of course, we-bare-bears to hug.
Food wise, their plating skills are superb. Each dish arrived are beautiful and insta-worthy. Some of the new dishes that we tried were the Pork Ribs ($20) and the Yuzu Butterfly Chicken ($18). The Yuzu Butterfly was perfect, as even the chicken breast was moist and flavourful. The Yuzu touch lifted the dish to a new level due to its citrusy profile.
The Pork Ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, but the batter was a tad too thick. Not that it taste really floury, but it's just filling. With that aside I believe this dish can be their speciality, as the flambé makes it extra insta-worthy and its succulent ribs are great for as well.
In a nutshell, The Communal Place has great food, great ambience, and has sharing dishes for a family. Can't wait to bring my friends here for dinner and drinks!",4
"I'm back to Comida Fiesta again and the food here taste really homely as usual. I had the Beef Caldereta which had such tender beef slices and a flavourful stew sauce that goes really well with rice. Rice is definitely a must order with this beef stew, as the flavours are really heavy! Other must orders include the Spanish chicken and sizzling pork sisig!
I would like to shout out to the service crew at Comida Fiesta, as their service was wonderful and they accommodated with most of our requests! It's really a hidden gem in the east!",4
"Three's a Crowd's ice cream is no stranger to me, as I would say that this cafe's homemade ice cream do have their standards. I got their 300g tub ($10 for normal flavours 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) because their ice cream really do stand out. The 2 flavours in the picture are my recommendations, as they are not too sweet. They also compliment each other well, as the chocolate flavour is REALLY rich, while the kris grey (earl grey) flavour is light and refreshing.",4
"Previously, I've always believed that buffets do not offer the quality of food that restaurants do, as they have to prepare them in big batches. However, Triple Three proved me wrong.
The weekend lunch buffet ($78++) boasts a large variety of food of many different cuisines and I can safety say that almost all of them are of very high standards.
Notable ones are the salmon sashimi cuts, as these are much thicker and fresher than what you can get in restaurants. The ribeye cut is really tender, and trust me, you can cut it with a spoon. It's really juicy, you probably don't need any sauce to go with it.
Service here is absolutely wonderful, as most staffs are really courteous! If you have a special someone to bring for a birthday treat, they have complimentary birthday cake and song service too!",5
"First thing I noticed was the really long queue at creamier, and I knew that I didn't waste my time coming down here when I stay in the East.
Me and my friends got the Earl Grey Lavender, white rabbit, plain ole chocolate, pistachio, peanut butter jelly and Thai milk tea ice cream. My favourites? All of them.
However, the Earl Grey Lavender and pistachio did give me the biggest impression. The Earl Grey Lavender was a burst of floral notes which was really refreshing. As for the pistachio ice cream, I finally found the shop with pistachio cream that taste like pistachio.",5
"Got the Bruno mixed grill ($32.80) and the meat were burnt and really tough. They were also really salty, including the fries given as a side. What can I say, the mashed potato was the best thing on the plate. Probably not coming back again.",2
"The fish head steamboat's soup was rather sweet, and the fish parts were very fresh. We ordered a couple of sides as well, and the prawn paste chicken was a hit, but the salted egg yolk prawns were not, as the prawns weren't that fresh. Our bill amounted to $120 plus for 7 people, which is rather steep considering the amount that we ordered.",4
"Dabao-ed a packet of black carrot cake ($2.80) from my neighbourhood coffeeshop and I must say their carrot cake do have the standards.
The portions are huge (equal portions of egg and carrot cake too) and it is really fragrant too. The chilli is probably what that stands out most from other stalls, as it has the full on flavour of the fermented shrimps. However it is REALLY spicy so just take a little!",4
"Craving for desserts after your meal? You know where to go. Three's a Crowd ice cream is really smooth and flavours are strong as well. I ordered their double scoop ice cream ($3/$3.50 per scoop for normal/premium flavours 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and their pandan waffles ($7) to go with them.
The chocolate flavour is a must get, as it is not so sweet, but yet so rich on their chocolate flavours. Kris Grey flavour is a neutralizing flavour if you are getting many rich flavours, as it is not sweet and the early grey tea notes is really refreshing. The pandan waffles, though crispy and fluffy, were too salty and I will just take it to be a one-off thing.
The service there is really good as always, and it does complete the whole dining experience!",4
"Tried this stall my first time today, and the first thing I noticed was the different noodle used. The Maggi noodles were thinner in size, but they do soak up the mala flavours more. Portions are generous as me and my friend ordered a $20 bowl but we were unable to finish!",4
"One look at this and you can imagine the size of the fish they gave us. They were generous in their portions and when you thought all of it is probably just batter, cut open and you will reveal a thick layer of fish that tasted really fresh and clean. Add some malt vinegar into your fish and chips to make it less gelat as you wolf down this delicious plate of fried fish goodness",4
"I was afraid that the burger was going to be small as I was hungry, but boy I was wrong. The portion of the burger was huge and the burger itself surpassed my expected standards. The bacon on the top was pan fried well, as its flavours were released without being too hard to bite. Although the patty was a little dry, I had no other complaints for the flavour of the patty had the right level of smokiness. I'm really glad for the tangy sauce used in the burger as it eased down on the whole jelatiness of meal.",4
"I've been to Swee Choon for many instances, but it is the first today that I've tried their noodle dishes. In my honest opinion, I'm not a big fan of it as the dishes are good but lack the wow factor. Their dim sum dishes on the other hand, are consistently good. Dim sums to get are the steamed pork ribs that are bursting with umami flavours, the fried mee suah cake, their salted egg yolk buns and to finish off, their Portuguese egg tarts!
On a side note, you can reserve seats through Chope and pay through favepay for some cashbacks!",3
"The Shroomy Ragout Truffle ($9.9 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) has the right balance of creaminess and umami flavours. The mushroom cream sauce was heavy with the fresh mushroom flavours, and the pasta was of Al dente texture. The whole dish was accentuated by the truffle oil used. This is dish would be the favourite for all mushroom lovers. The Hot Chocolate ($4.2 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) was fantastic and was heavy with its chocolate-ly flavours.
Coming to this cafe 2 times in row, and countless number of times for the past 5 years, I must say the quality of food here have been superb and I will definitely miss the food here after it closes this coming sun 31st March.",4
"I must say their earl grey milk tea with boba ($3.10 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is really good if you are craving for some milk tea around the neighbourhood. You know they use good earl grey tea leaves, and the bobas are of the right chewy texture. Prices are really reasonable, considering such standards!!",4
"The first notion that you know that the food is good, is the whiff of it when it arrives at your table. The combination of the truffle and bacon smell would definitely entice anyone. The sausages were succulent and the bread with truffle spread goes really with the perfectly executed scrambled eggs. The bacon slices completed their only all-day breakfast item, the To-gather Big Breakfast ($11 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond).
The food was amazing, the ambience was really cosy, and as a loyal supporter since my secondary school days, I would recommend this to anyone. However, it's so sad to hear that they are closing down this 31st March. Head there while you can!",4
"Think you will only get bursts of soup from xiao long baos? Think again as this stall's wo tie (pan fried dumplings) ($6 for 10) have that same bursts of meat juices spilling out of the skin the moment you bite onto them.
The chilli dumplings ($4.50 for 10) are really good as well, as the skin was silky smooth, the fillings were equally as flavourful, and the chilli vinegar sauce sure packed a punch.
Such high quality dumplings sure brings me back to my holidays in China, and its great to know I can eat them here in my home country.",4
"Really good wings and tasty cheese fries. The parmesan boneless chicken wasn't a hit though, as the batter wasn't as good as the one on their chicken wings. The kecap manis wings though are really good but can be really spicy. The celery and carrot sticks really seemed out of place here but hey no harm getting the fibre you need right?",4
"The meal at Comida Fiesta was initially skeptical, as it was an empty restaurant located at expo. However, we were lucky that we weren't fooled by the external appearance as the food were really fantastic, especially the pork sisig. It has a good blend of savoury and smoky flavours, the lime added a citrus touch to the dish, and the raw egg held everything together nicely. Furthermore, the portion was amazingly huge. It was a really hearty meal! Will be back for more!",4
The shrimp wanton noodle ($9.95) has a really good broth with 4 large wantons that are filled full with juicy shrimps. The winner of the meal has to be the chilli as they used roasted dried chilli with sichuan peppercorns for the smoky flavour and numbing sensation that added another dimension to the dish.,4
"Dian Xiao Er boasts high quality food, wonderful ambience and high standards of service. Their Mongolian pork ribs have a smoky garlicky flavour with a chilli spice that gives you a certain kick. Vegetable dishes wise they are not oily nor too salty. Their signature herbal roast duck is really good as the dangui herbs will offset the usual gelat-ness of roast duck, making it really addictive. The service in Dian Xiao Er is amazing, as although we were at the corner table, they did not forget about our request and served our dinner promptly. What a wonderful meal!!!",5
"The rock salt salmon here is to die for, as the salmon meat is so tender and yet so flavourful, which makes it so addictive. The meats selection are really extensive, so is the dessert section. Overall, the food quality here I would say it isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. Service I have to say is really good and the staffs here are really friendly. However, the buffet price here is high, at 88++ per person for a weekend lunch.",4
"The sashimi slices were really thick and fresh, and the rice had the right amount of vinegar in them; they were good enough to eat on their own! The only small disappointment would be the size of the Don, as I would definitely want to eat more of such good quality food!
However, such will be a steal if you use burpple beyond!",4
"Fresh mala ingredients especially the mushrooms, cheap prices and in my neighbourhood? Those are what that are making me coming back for more. $13 for 2 people.",3
"One word to describe this: SHIOK! The only way one should eat this is to mix everything together, and all of the ingredients harmonise with one another so well. Together with the onsen egg, everything sticks to the noodle really well. I would think this is the best bowl to get from Kajiken, as the minced meat is the easiest to mix together with the noodles and it has that wonderful umami flavour that is absolutely addictive.
Do upsize your noodles and get the bowl of rice at the end if you are feeling hungry, or just want to soak up all the delicious sauce and chow down everything! The fragrant chilli oil and white vinegar do add another dimension to the dish, highly recommended to add some!
Best of all, with #burpplebeyond, you can enjoy this dish which breaking much of a hole in your wallet!",5
"I expected the Blue Chai Hokkaido Milk ice cream to taste really artificial, but instead it tasted really amazing, as the milky hokkaido milk complemented the subtle chai tea flavours really well. We also ordered the Earl Grey ice cream, that was equally smooth and fragrant! Paired with chocolate lava cookie, you have a matchmake in heaven. Using burpple beyond, 2 lava sets and 2 tea drinks amounted to $14.80.",4
"This is my first time trying the dry Bak Kut Teh, and I am really impressed by the sauce that coats around the meat. It is really savory and yet really fragrant, hence a great sauce to accompany with rice! The chilli frog legs were amazing as well, as it was really tender and flavourful at the same time. We also ordered a plate of clams which were SUPER fresh!",4
"Tucked away in a hidden side of Shaw tower, lies tom's palatte, a homely ice cream parlour. One would expect nothing good from such parlour lying in an old shopping mall, but looks can be deceiving.
The Yuzu ice cream is really refreshing as the citrus tangy sourness will definitely surprise you. A good ice cream to offset other heavy flavours.
The Chocolate Stout alcoholic ice cream boasts strong alcoholic flavours, not for the alcohol haters. The chocolate does complement with Guinness, but it would be better if the alcohol can be toned down a little, as the stout quickly overpowered the chocolate flavours.
The very interesting CNY special Kueh Bangkit ice cream is surprisingly good, as it really taste like the real biscuit. The best part is that because its in ice cream form, it manages to replicate the melt-in-the-mouth sensation you will be looking for in every Kueh Bangkit biscuit.
Now for the star of the show, the Rum and Rasin. Most rum and Rasin I've tried everywhere else failed to achieve what i personally was looking for, but tom's palatte is the closest to it. Their creation was creamy yet extremely smooth. The rum itself was subtle, but enough to tickle your taste buds. It was so addictive. Only thing I wished more would be more raisins in my ice cream.
Tom's palatte, you've done it and bought me totally. This is easily one of the best ice creams I've had so far. Totally impressed and will definitely be back for more. Well done!",4
"The Vongole Ppong ($17.90 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) is rather light on flavour, which is something great to have if you are having the whole bowl to yourself because the portion is really HUGE. They are rather generous with the ingredients as well, as the bowl came with an abundant amount of clams and mussels!
The Ro Ppong Roje, which is tomato cream Ppong with cheese is really heavy but satisfying at the same time due to the amount of cheese they added in. However, it can be really ""gelat"" after a few mouthfuls. Totally recommended to get these 2 using beyond to share with your buddy!",4
"The soy milk from rocher beancurd is really different from anywhere else, as the soybeans used are really of a different standard! A great drink to have while walking around the bugis area :)",4
"I love the fruity flavours here in mei heong yuan, as the fruit flavourings do not taste artificial somehow, and they do add real fruit silces to go with the ice shavings! It's not too sweet and would probably suit most palettes.",4
"The claypot rice at Sembawang traditional claypot rice ($19.80 for L) really has the smoky taste that I was looking for! The rice was really flavourful as well, and they really didn't skim on the ingredients. Try out their seafood da ru mian as well, as the warm gravy packs the seafood goodness that is addictive!",4
"One of my favourites from the dark gallery is the single origin chocolate ice cream platter, as there are 3 different types of ice cream to taste. Each flavour is really intense and thick; probably one of the best chocolate ice creams around. Thanks to #burpplebeyond, I get to have 1 for 1 set at just $14. Great value for such quality!",4
"The food at waa cow surpassed me and my friends' expectations, as the aburi wagyu beef Don sent us straight to food haven. The wagyu beef slices are really tender and juicy, and fats within the beef itself melts and complements perfectly with the charred flavour you get from the crust of the slices. Mentaiko with beef might sound gimmicky, but they actually go together really well, and in fact lifted the flavour of the beef. It's easily one of the best beef dons I've had in Singapore.
Service wise the service staffs were top-notch as they were polite, and treated us like a family. They looked after our needs and gave us extra salads that were very much appreciated.
Yes the total set might cost around $30, but it was definitely worth every cent. Will be back for more!",5
"Onepot boasts a wide range of ingredients, and the vegetable, mushroom and meat selections are rather fresh. Although the meats are rather tough, they are still good to eat with the mala broth. The seafood on the other hand can be fresher. The vast sauce selections are worth a mention.
One must get will be the flat orange cheese fish cake, as when thrown in the hotpot, the cheese in the middle will melt and ooze out as you bite into it, giving you the cheesy oomph factor you will crave for.
With #burpplebeyond each person will pay around $22, which I feel is an okay pricing for what that is offered.",4
"Tried the grilled chicken chop ($4.50) from fins and feathers and it was a decently grilled chicken with a crispy crust. Though the sauce can be better, the fries were good as they were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Great for a casual meal!",4
"I'm back here again for the piccolo cup, because with burpple beyond its such a steal. $7.60 for 4 scoops of Italian gelato? (includes premium flavours) It's just so difficult to find nowadays. The pistachio gelato is really worth a comment, because it's absolutely not grainy at all and flavour of the pistachio is really strong. Totally my go-to dessert house in bugis!",4
"I ordered the 3 little pigs burger ($18 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and was surprised by the portion given. The nachos sides were of substantial amounts and were great with the salsa given. The burger itself was phenomenal. 2 pork patties, a slice of spam, a slice of pork belly and 2 bacon wrapped sausages? Thats what I'm talking about. The pork patties are really juicy and full on flavour. The pork belly was charred perfectly and melts in the mouth. Chill place, great food and craft beers? Sign me up!",5
"So far, I've got to say chir chir serves the best Korean chicken hotplates, as their chicken is really well marinated, and tender as well! I ordered the chi-queen and garlic roasted chicken ($32.80 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) and had no regrets. The fried chicken tenders in the chi-queen were well fried, and were perfect with the melty gooey cheese. The garlic roasted chicken were REALLY tender, and were bursting with the garlic oomph flavours you will crave for. What a perfect meal to share with friends! Perfect for groups of 3-4!",4
"One thing I have to say is the size of the desserts. Don't be fooled by the size of the cup, because they will pack the cup full with the ice cream they use. I ordered the oneh-oneh and white chocolate tiramisu soft serve ($4.80 1 for 1 #burpplebeyond) . The vanilla ice cream is really sweet, the oneh-oneh is really coconutty, but the tiramisu soft serve is missing the coffee notes it should have. I feel like this store really has potential, and will be back to try the other flavours.",4
"For those who have not tried soup Bak Chor Mee, it's really different from the usual chilli bak chor mee you can get anymore, as what matters alot is the soup brewed. This stall's soup BCM boasts a light and slight porky broth. The pork balls are the normal ones you can get from supermarkets. Overall it is a decent bowl of noodles that is worth getting for supper, as they open till rather late.",3
"After a long day, nothing beats Ah Balling's peanut soup with tangyuan, as it is the best hot dessert to get around the region due to its warm sweet soup with chewy tangyuan that will definitely lighten your mood, no matter what you've been through. Throughout my whole life this has been my go-to comfort food, and since 5 tangyuans only set you back at $2.40, I don't see why people would reject such desserts.",4
"Come during their lunch promo timings (12pm - 4pm), and be greeted by their $5 dons that are really good considering their price point, as well as the quality of food! Their chicken cutlet curry Don has a decent curry sauce that is not too salty, but yet still addictive. The chicken cutlet is not over fried. A great place for a chill lunch!!",4
"The Italian herbs crusted fish and chips ($12 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) had a really big portion and I almost couldn't finish the meal. The fish itself, though I can't really taste the herbs, was really good because they used a good and fresh flaky fish fillet. In fact, this is probably the best fish and chips I've had for some time!
The Uji Matcha latte is also worth a mention, because the matcha powder comes from matchaya, my favourite to-go place for Matcha cravings! It wasn't too sweet and Matcha was intense enough. What a great place for a meetup with your friends especially if you live around the east! Best of all, no GST and service charge!",4
"Personally, I feel that this stall does one of the best ban mians in Singapore. The highlight of the bowl would be the mian guo itself, because they are really thick and chewy, and the floury taste isn't too strong! The soup is really flavourful, and you know that it's natural goodness, not from simple MSG. They are really generous with their ingredients, especially the meats and fried anchovies. Totally worth my trip down from the east!",5
"Hidden in the tampines neighbourhood, lies a small mala joint that is really popular among the people around the neighbourhood. Prices are affordable, because its $1/$2 for each portion of vege/normal meats. The portions are really HUGE and you can really taste the wok hei. Drinks are rather expensive, but a Wang Lao Ji sure resolves the spicy kick from the mala fragrant pot!",5
"The foie gras is absolutely amazing, that I have to say. There is little to no gaminess, and it is so soft you can easily cut it using your chopsticks. The burst of umami flavours as the foie gras melts in your mouth is unbelievable. The fried garlic on the foie gras lifted the flavours of the buttery goodness.
However, I was slightly disappointed by the yakiniku don itself, because the rice seemed to be overdone, and the meat was slightly tough.",4
"Came here to eat by chance and had the tonkotsu sukiyaki ramen. (10+ for students). The soup to me was a little too salty, and wasn't fragrant enough. The noodles were just decent. The sukiyaki were a little tough but they were fine. Honestly for the student price, it is satisfying enough. Try mixing the egg yolk from the onsen egg into the soup before eating. It will make everything better!",3
"Hot melty lava chocolate and delicious thick ice cream? You have a winner. The matcha lava cookie isn't as impressive as the chocolate one, but the mild Matcha flavour goes really well with the thick intense dark chocolate. The chocolate lava cookie on the other hand was oozing with so much chocolate its extremely satisfying. Paired with Earl Grey ice cream, the floral notes from the Earl Grey complements the thick chocolate lava. Both cookies had a satisfying crunch on the sides. A really satisfying (but sinful) dessert indeed!",4
"The main winner of this dish is the noodles. The noodles are lightly coated in shallot oil and are really firm, giving them both the right texture and flavour. The char siew are not the ""cardboard"" kind available in most wanton mee, and are flavourful, with the right amount of char. The Thai sausages given are also worth a mention, as they were like upgraded versions of Taiwan sausages. The portions are okay and this bowl is definitely worth a trip down!!",4
"The beef offered in this set meal is absolutely amazing, as it was full on flavour and really tender as well. The eggy sukiyaki sauce that the steak was in accompanied the steak really well, giving it a savoury to its natural sweetness. Although the accompanying tendon bowl was abit of a miss because of the soggy batter, the prawn used was fresh. The salmon sashimi as a side were fresh and thick.",4
"The ice cream waffles at laundry gallery ($12.50 1 for 1 with #burpplebeyond) are probably the best waffles you can get around here because the plain waffles themselves are so crispy and fluffy IT'S INSANE. I would recommend their sea salt caramel and chocolate ice cream as they had the right blend of saltiness and sweetness, and the OOMPH from the intense cocoa flavour respectively.
What made the cafe experience complete was the service from the owner. He is so polite and he really takes pride in whatever he does! Will be back for more real soon!",5
"I wouldn't think nice food can be churned out from this eatery but oh my I was wrong. I ordered the truffle pasta, grilled chicken and roasted mushrooms and they were REALLY FRESH. the ingredients are taken from the supermarket behind, and the chefs did the cooking really well. The truffle pasta had a hint of truffle oil that would keep you addicted yet not ""gelat"" after eating a few mouthfuls. The grilled chicken was on point with their char and seasoning. The mushroom was crunchy and had the natural sweetness I was looking for. Such will be a great meal and will not cost a huge damage if you live around the area!",4
"The milk tea had a distinctive taste that is different from other milk teas from other places, and to top it off, 50% sugar didn't make the drink too sweet and it was refreshing and addictive enough for one to down the whole cup throughout a meal.",4
"Swee Choon's food is really good, especially the prawn dumplings, which we could resist but to order 5 plates! Each piece is stuffed with crunchy fresh prawns, that were really sweet. The wonderful spicy sour soup is definitely a must get, as it was a big bowl @ $4.50; a complete steal. I wish that I can mention more dishes, but I'm afraid the list goes on and on as each of the 20 dishes that we ordered were absolutely amazing!
On a side note, I was really impressed with swee choon's service, especially a staff that helped to clear a confusion between the order from 2 tables. In the midst of the chaos of a busy Fri dinner service, he managed to redirect the correct orders to the correct tables to minimize disturbance to the customers. Well done indeed!",5
"ARoma's Italian gelato boasts light flavours and smooth ice cream textures that will fit the palatte of any ice cream lover. The piccolo cup ($6.90 with a premium flavour 1 for 1 with #BurppleBeyond) had generous amounts of ice cream in each cup, and the chocolate flavour would definitely be the winner, as the cocoa used were intense and it was not too sweet.
Honestly, it's really difficult to find authentic Italian gelatos that will offer double scoops at such a price point and its definitely worth it to bring your friends down for ice cream if you are done with a meal around the area!",4
"I've been to Kogane Yama for a couple of times to try their different donburis, and they have not disappointed me once. The Gyu Don ($13.90 1 for 1 with #BurppleBeyond) has the right amount of meat to rice ratio. The beef slices are really tender and flavourful. I loved the addition of garlic chips to their dish, because it added a new layer of texture and flavour to the dish that makes it addictive. The onsen egg helped to bind everything together. Its probably one of the best beef don you can find in SG at its price, and I'm sure I will be back to this place soon enough.",5
"A Michelin starred restaurant would never cut short on their service efforts, and Putien is no exception. Tonight's dinner service at Putien didn't disappoint me at all. From the ordering of food to the end of the meal, Putien staffs here are very polite and meticulous, as they asked my family for any food allergies as we ordered, and asked for our feedback at the end of the meal.
As for the food quality, expect flavours that are not too heavy on the palatte. Because of that, most foods are really delicious and easy to down. Mains like the white ru mian are great to share, and are really hearty. The entire dinner session in Putian is really good and family is really pleased with the food and service.",4
"The signature Miam Miam Spaghetti ($17.20++) came to me as a surprise as I didn't expect such fresh ingredients used. Unlike many other restaurant chains, the pasta had an al dente texture and didn't taste like it was pre-cooked. The ingredients used were fresh, especially the sweet and juicy tomato. The best would be the onsen egg, as when mixed with the pasta, provides a thick coating around the pasta noodles which gave them the oomph flavour. A wonderful dish indeed!",5
"Ate at the famous nakhon kitchen that has several outlets around Singapore. Personally, I was a little disappointed because the amount given was somewhat smaller than what you can get at the original bedok branch. As for food quality, the bedok branch is a little better, but for the price and location, its great!
The Thai green curry ($8 not in picture) was definitely worth a mention as the curry and Thai basil flavours were intense enough and the coconut milk added thickened the curry and made it more flavourful.
Though I waited half an hour for my Pad Thai ($6), the service staffs saved the whole dining experience as they accidentally overheard our conversation that one of our friend couldn't take spicy food and asked if she wanted more cold water.",3
"Directly behind Changi City Point lies the changi business park, where Mr Samurai is. I wasn't much from this restaurant as it was way too quiet, but the quality of food they delivered surpassed most Japanese eateries.
I ordered the chicken kaarage curry rice ($5.5 for daily special), and the chicken kaarage was the winner of the dish. The chicken was way crispier than most fried chicken branches, and the meat within was really juicy. The rice given was of a good amount, and the curry was of good quality.
Overall its a hidden gem in the Changi Business Park, and its great to go if you work there.",4
"Had double scoop ice cream ($6.50 for non-premium 1 for 1 #burpplebeyond) and ordered the cookies and cream, vanilla, salted caramel and dark chocolate ice cream. Firstly I got to say the scoops were HUMONGOUS and would definitely require more than 2 to share.
The cookies and cream and vanilla were decent, as its difficult to go wrong with it. The salted caramel was interesting and was a good blend with the other ice cream flavours as its saltiness can offset the sweetness from the other flavours.
The dark chocolate ice cream on the other hand, was LEGENDARY. Its definitely a must get, as the amount of cocoa in it is amazing. Dab your spoon in the ice cream and you know how thick it is. With a strong cocoa flavour, and it's smooth melty texture, it's a real orgasmic moment in your mouth.",4
"The fish and chips from fish tales is not too bad, though its not too good either. Great place for a student meal if you're around the area, as a fish and chip with a cup of ice lemon tea will only set you back by $7.90.",3
"The soft serve and drink set ($10 1 for 1 with burpple beyond) might be a little too much for 2 people, but it's perfect with 4. The hojicha soft serve is a must-get, because it has the smoky green tea flavour that is hard to find in most places. The sweetness of the ice cream is neutralised by the bitterness of the green tea, but the bitterness of the green tea is absolutely pleasant and in fact addictive.
The Royal milk tea can be described as a mild flavoured milk tea, but you know that there's quality ingredients used. The hojicha milk tea is perfect for people who love ayataka tea, as it is quite bitter, but I loved it as the green tea flavour is really strong.
Overall its perfect for a dessert treat before or after a movie, and would be a wonderful place to bring your Matcha lover friends!",5
"Nuodle's beef noodles are really authentic, and they offer a light beef broth that will definitely warm your body in a wet rainy day. The handmade noodles are really chewy and firm to the bite. The beef pancakes are really good too, as they were crunchy on the outside and really flavourful inside! My favourite side would be the braised egg, with the half runny egg yolk that is absolutely satisfying.
To top it all off, the customer service at nuodle is really excellent, as they will cater to your needs patiently.",4
"At less than 500m away from Clarke Quay where all the clubs and bars are, BK Eating House (open 24H) is a great spot to get your supper fix after a night of drinking. I ordered the Signature Dry Mee Sua ($4), which I find rather unique, because it is usually mee pok or mee kia that is drenched in the BCM kind of chilli sauce. After a few mouthfuls of the mee sua, I discovered the reason why most people would order this. I find myself strangely slurping up mouthfuls after mouthfuls of mee sua without feeling the gelat-ness, which is rather apparent in mee kia and mee pok noodles. It's a great bowl of noodles that would fit everyone's appetite, and fill your hungry belly.",4
"I ordered the mocha choco and tiramisu flavour and they were absolutely amazing. The ice cream were as thick as they look, but were smooth on the palatte. I was afraid that they were overly sweet, but it was just nice. Best of all, it was just $3 for a double scoop with beyond!",4
"Headed there for weekend lunch at a promotional price of $18.90++ and had a great time with my family! Loved the meat selection there, as they were all well marinated! Best of all, it's Halal and I can't wait to bring my Muslim friends there!",4
"First thing I have to say, is that this burger is to die for.
The burger bun is really CRISPY on the outside, just like potato crackers that you eat, and the butter smothered beneath made the buns really addictive to eat on its own.
The THICK layer of melted flavourful cheese on top of the patty would satisfy the cravings of any cheese lover, and is definitely a food-porn to look at.
The patty got to be the main show, as it was perfectly cooked medium and was BURSTING with JUICES that would send you straight up to food haven.
With beyond 1 for 1 and wonderful food and atmosphere, guys it's definitely WORTH the calories. Got to be one of the best burgers I've eaten in Singapore.",5
"Mei Heong Yuan desserts are definitely not as satisfying as compared to the popular bingsus in town, but hey for its price, its a snatch! The ice shavings are light in flavour, but they still do satisfy your dessert cravings! Get the vouchers on fave, to get them at 2 for $6.50!
Recommend flavour: Milk Tea",3
The chicken is roasted to perfection and has a slightly crispy crust with a garlicky-oomphy sauce coated around it. The chicken is tender and juicy and the portion is rather huge so do bring at least 2 people along with you to share this amazing goodness!!,4
"Just the right amount of heat, firm noodles, juicy prawns and squids, affordable... What else can I say? Definitely worth a trip down!",4
"Using burpple beyond, I only paid about 11 dollars for this bowl of crispy goodness. All of the tempura are not too oily and are juicy on the inside! Would be a great place for a date!!",4
"Do not be fooled by the appearance of the restaurant, as you will be taken aback by how good the food is in here. The salmon mentai Don ($10 small/ $13 big) is extremely flavourful, and the salmon is torched to perfection. The mentaiko, together with the salmon, will definitely send you to food heaven!!
The additional side of salmon sashimi (9.50 for 5 pieces) were REALLY thick and fresh, totally worth the order!
Do note that they serve mentai dons only from 1230 onwards, and I recommend ordering the big bowl as the small bowl is really tiny!",4
"This is something worth queuing for. The kohaku original tendon bowl ($14) contains so many pieces of fried pieces of vegetable, chicken breast meat and seafood that I left half of the amount after finishing up the rice. The rice used is of a premium kind, and hence good enough to eat on its own. The chicken breast meat is extremely tender and succulent. The seafood, as usual, did not disappoint as they were fresh and perfectly cooked without being too tough. A wonderful dining experience indeed!",5
"Imagine a hamburger steak that is extremely flavourful and so tender that it nearly melts in your mouth... Keisuke has it. Furthermore, it comes with a free flow salad bar with tons of vegetables and a number of cold pastas to go with the hamburger steak. The service is amazing as you will be given a paper bib, so that the sizzling juices will not stain your clothes!
Price: 18.90++ /20.90++ with cheese",4
"Among bars and small cafes lies a small humble ice cream shop that boasts more than 20 flavours of ice cream. From the classic vanilla bean ice cream, to unique avocado gula meleka flavour, you will definitely be thrown into a dilemma of what ice cream flavours to get. The ice cream they offer are not too sweet and are strong on flavour. From $3.80 a scoop, and an additional weekdays 1 for 1 promotion, there is no reason why you shouldnt end off your meal at katong over here!",4
"The regular platter ($49.80, feeds 3-4 pax) came with:
- 3x sirloin steak
- 3x grilled chicken steak
- 3x grilled fish fillet
- 7 spicy chicken drumlets
- 3 chosen sides
And a HUGE amount of onion rings and fries! The steak was cooked to my desired doneness, the chicken steak were flavourful and the fish fillet were fresh. The onion rings were amazing, but the star of the dish was the drumlets, drenched in a spicy soy sauce that was extremely addictive. Gather 3 other friends, and prepare to leave the restaurant with a food coma.
Overall, the Wicked Grill is a good place for a gathering, and a perfect place to settle your meat cravings at an affordable price! Besides, the Wicked Grill sells beer at affordable prices, and alcohol and meat is THE perfect combo! Will definitely head back again!",4
"The famed fishball noodles from Fa Ji minced meat noodle ($3.50/4.50) definitely lived up to its name! In fact, I believe it surpassed my standards for a humble bowl of noodles! An amazingly fragrant chilli sauce blanketed the noodles and though they were soaked in it, the noodles remained its springy texture. They were generous with the accompanying ingredients and the liver slices were almost melt-in-the-mouth. This bowl is totally worth queueing for!",5
"The fish soup noodles ($3.50) from 海鲜之家 boasts a rich and aromatic seafood broth that is really addictive! With 6 slices of fish that are firm and succulent with each bite, I believe this bowl is a steal. Furthermore, they gave me a few slices of my favourite bittergroud and they gave the soup a hint of its flavour, making the soup a level tastier!",4
"Bad photo quality, because I would never have expected this kway chap to be a hidden gem in the east. For $4, I was given a good amount of ingredients to go with my warm bowl of flat rice noodles, and they were superb. The braised pork intestines had only a mild odour, in contrast with most other stalls that don't clean the intestines properly. The pig skin was really springy, and the braised beancurd was soft and full of flavour of the broth. However, the taupok was a tad too salty for me, but it was perfect with the mildly flavoured yet refreshing bowl of soup. A really satisfying meal on a rainy day!",4
